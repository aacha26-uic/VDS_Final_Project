3253_NormalText-INTERVIEW_ONLY_02-04-21I.edited.txt," Okay. When I was a uh, senior in high school, uh college sorry, college. Um, I should say before that time I gotten very interested in buying a movie camera because uh they were becoming cheaper and I could afford something. So I bought one, and I fiddled around using an 8 milimeter movie camera to take pictures of the family. Then when I was a senior in college. I was a cadet cornel of the ROTC group, and as such I was uh leading uh at a big parade or review, and uh was getting a lot of uh pubblocity like on the campus, _x0080__x0098_cause every year they had such an event. And my   mother said she would like some photographs of it, and I said you can use my camera. And my camera was one that folded down and they, instead of a tripod you held the bottom of the camera, and then you, you wounde it up and then push on the button and it made the film run through. And I expllained to her how it worked, and said, _x0080__x009c_Okay, thats fine_x0080__x009d_. So, she was in the stands watching the parade  and she I guess was filminging it, _x0080__x0098_cause I was marching. So we finished the parade and they, we sent the film to be developed .  Got it back, and I had this little uh projector thing and we thought we look and see what the film was like.  We turn on the projector and she had done a great job of everything except her finger was all over the lens for the whole thing, and mostly it was over me. So all this time she was trying to catch a picture of me doung something decent for a change, uh she had her finger over the lens. And none of that material got into the film, so I still have that 8 millimeter film it helps me feel humble sometimes.  INTERVWERER  Do you remember where you were doing in the parade? what was?  I was, I was the, I was the big time cheese. I was in front of the troops.  And I was all decked out in uniform and I had all these troops behind me, they_x0080__x0099_re all college students.   And I was the leader. Thats why I was standing out for a change, and she just put her finger over the lens   I do, I do have it, yes. And it gives us somthing to chuckle about every once and awhile.

Anyway so we went to (uh) (the) the taxi driver (um) I asked him if there were any congregational churches in town (and) and he said _x0080__x009c_Yes I_x0080__x0099_d love you to come to my church_x0080__x009d_ and that was when I first realized that his church was for Black people and my other church (uh) they had a separate church for white people. (uh) So I went to the one for Black people and I was well received but that's a different event. So I got settled in my dorm and I took off those clothes I_x0080__x0099_d been wearing on the plane and put on a pair of decent shorts and a shirt because it was really hot in early September and I walked down the hall of the dorm where I was gonna be staying (and) and (um) one of the graduate student said, _x0080__x009c_Where are you going in those pants?_x0080__x009d_ I said, _x0080__x009c_I_x0080__x0099_m going to go walk downtown and buy a couple things._x0080__x009d_ And she said _x0080__x009c_You can't walk downtown in those shorts_x0080__x009d_ she said _x0080__x009c_(j*) (not) No you can't do that! yeah (they're) they're just (um) too bare._x0080__x009d_ Well they weren't by California standards they were fine, they were not what you see on the beach today. But I thought I would humor her so I went on into town and I saw there were two water fountains in the (um) department store. And one said _x0080__x009c_Colored_x0080__x009d_ and one said _x0080__x009c_white_x0080__x009d_ and I walked up to the Colored one and started to take a drink of water and I got tapped on the shoulder and she said _x0080__x009c_(you) (you) You must be new here you're drinking out of the wrong fountain._x0080__x009d_ (w*w*) I was beginning to think I was in the wrong place.  And I had materials (for some) for some other graduate schools and I sat down, I filled out the application to go to UCLA and I carried it to the post office and dropped it in the mail. I couldn't handle it. I couldn't handle treating Blacks as though they were not real people.  And I left. But before really the story let me say, that that attitude at Duke University changed not too many years after I was there and it's totally different today there's nothing like that happening there today.

3351_NormalText_INTERVIEW_ONLY_07-28-20.edited.txt," Well, the event I_x0080__x0099_d like to talk about is how I met my very best friend. It was around 1962 and I was invited to go play bridge with a group of three other women and uh at my, at this one friend's house, we started playing bridge and one of the members of that group was Emily. And Emily and I just kind of hit it off and uh arranged to meet again to go for a bicycle ride and to play tennis and to do several other things. We were living in uh Hartford, Connecticut. I was living at home at the time, and she had just moved from Rochester, New York uh down to Hartford and was living in a house uh with two other women and uh one of the women then decided to move out, get married and Emily said, _x0080__x009c_Why don't you fill, uh come in and move in with Sally and I?_x0080__x009d_ And I thought about it. I had a pretty good job with uh Southern New England telephone company that was in uh Hartford and uh thought, well I think this might be a new experience for me. I had uh not thought about getting my own apartment quite yet, but I decided that uh I'd like to meet Sally and see if this was something that was going to work. And so I did and the house was on Kingston Road in West Hartford and was certainly um possible for me to get to work from there and to uh still see my family who lived in the Hartford area. So, I packed up things in my Mustang, which I had bought I think probably just the year before and drove over and moved myself into my little room on the second floor at Kingswood Road and painted that room to purple, which I had always wanted to paint a bedroom purple, so I did that, moved all my things in there and met Sally and became good friend as well and the three of us really enjoyed lots of things in that house. Had parties, invited friends and I remember quite clearly one time meeting, I mean making a meal for my family, my sisters and my father, my aunt and a couple people came over for dinner and it was just quite a delight to be able to serve roast beef and Yorkshire pudding and sitting down there in our own little kitchen, and that was an event that I remember and then, what happened after that was Emily and I decided to take a trip together and so we planned uh to take a cruise to Bermuda and that has been something that I'll remember forever because it was kind of costly at the time, but it was purely, purely just joy to be on this ocean liner and cruise to Bermuda and then we stayed in what we then known as a guest home, probably now an Airbnb, with Miss Susanna Bell who brought us fresh scones and orange marmalade in the morning in this bright sunny room and then we toured Bermuda, and of course, met a couple of male friends that made it even more memorable and we became a lifelong friendship for Emily and I. We continued to live together in that house on Kingston and then in another house in West Hartford on um the boulevard it was called and  this was a bigger home we took in a fourth roommate and uh, again, I painted my room purple and lived there for another three or four years until um I think Emily was the first to get married and then I moved to Boston when I got married, but we have continued our friendship. She now lives in Rochester, New York back in Rochester and I live in San Diego, California different sides of the world or different sides of the country and we have kept up this friendship all these years and now of course you know by phone and by visits she has two girls I have a girl and a boy, and we_x0080__x0099_ve had our families meet each other been to weddings and uh now of course we can visit with zoom which is quite wonderful and introduce each other to our grandchildren so and I hope to continue the Friendship for a very, very long time.  Well, first of all, I was a horrible bridge player and she was very patient with me as a partner and secondly, I was interested in what she had to say because she was a very open, uh she was an artist number one and she had so many different experiences from what I had growing up and we share that and found out much, much later that her last name was Goodyear, but actually, her father was Italian, and he had changed his name from Guanajuato and I am Italian, so we have that connection that we didn't even know about for many years, but it was just a comfortableness that I had with her and,  we seem to want to share so many things together. Foreign movies were another thing we use to, there was an art theater in, in Hartford and we would both love to go to those movies and then go out for like fish and chips after something like that, so it was just a comfortable relationship which it still is we share everything every book we read, movies that we_x0080__x0099_ve seen, things about our children and I think it's just amazing that after all these years of living apart, she lived in Atlanta for many years we lived here, it continued and I have other friends, but I don't think any of them are that sincere that close.

3373_NormalText_INTERVIEW_ONLY_03-11-21.edited.txt," When I was in college at San Luis Obispo at Cal Poly and my ex husband was there to. My parents loaned us their Volks Wagon because they were in New York and so we would have two cars. When they were going to return to LAX, I needed to drive the car too LAX and pick my parents up but I also needed my ex husband to drive the other car so that we would have a way to get back to San Luis Obispo. I was driving my car old Volks Wagon but then he decided he couldn_x0080__x0099_t go so he got a friend to go with him to take the other car. So the friend has the my parents newer Volks Wagon we left San Luis Obispo and we were keeping each other in sight of each other. Well this guy obviously didn_x0080__x0099_t know that a woman needs to go to the bathroom every once in a while. So I when I pulled over into a gas station he wasn_x0080__x0099_t paying attention. So I went into the gas station went to the toilet came back out and his car is not there. So I_x0080__x0099_m thinking oh my gosh he_x0080__x0099_s gone on without me. So I start chugging down the highway thinking I_x0080__x0099_ll catch up with him and I went all the way to Santas Barbara and never saw him. But in the meantime he_x0080__x0099_s realized something happened and gone back and I wasn't at the gas station so he started after me at Santa Barbara north of Santa Barbara there_x0080__x0099_s a police or highway patrol station. I pulled up into the highway patrol station that left no I pulled up turned the u turn left my car on the roadside went up into the highway patrol station to ask the guys what to do and he did come behind me and see that the car was there. So we met up there and to get the rest of the way to LA and the lesson I learned if you are ever driving with anybody you should definitely make a plan for where you_x0080__x0099_re going to stop and rest and what you_x0080__x0099_re going to do.  Beats me I well it was probably less than you can do now because there wasn_x0080__x0099_t a freeway then. In the old days the roads between San Luis Obispo and southern California was just a two-lane road now it_x0080__x0099_s a big freeway so probably a lot longer. Two stops highway patrol station and the other one at the gas station yeah.  I remember thinking I was gonna be in big trouble with my parents yes and you know when it gets down to it I can_x0080__x0099_t remember who had their car. I must_x0080__x0099_ve had or he must_x0080__x0099_ve had it who knows because that_x0080__x0099_s what I was probably worried about.

3425_NormalText_INTERVIEW_ONLY_01-29-21.edited.txt," June, twenty seventh, nineteen seventy, Ed and I got married. It was one o'clock wedding and...so we got ready in the morning and I had made these head piece, my own head piece...my...were my sister's wedding dress. We were on a low budget because when I was in college my parents said that they would either give me a car or pay for my wedding and I took the car, so Ed and I were paying for our own wedding, and I had a job making a dollar thirty five an hour and he had a job making a dollar fifty an hour. So we were very low budget...low budget wedding in the seventies. Thank goodness they did not have dinners included in weddings in those days, so I again...I borrowed my sister's wedding dress. I...I carried a lovely bouquet. And I had my, let's see, I had my sister, my best friend that I had gone to Europe with because we had just...we become super good friends traveling during the summer, and my two sister-in-laws were my bridesmaids. And so we made all of the dresses together cause I did a lot of sewing and I made their head pieces and they were really cute. We round...ribbon around, we stuck pins in it, we missed it and made little curls that came down on their head and they were each carrying a bouquet of a single red rose because that's what we could afford at that time. It was a lovely wedding. Ed's parents were very supportive. They paid for a nice dinner at...for the wedding party at Sir George xxx in Chula Vista. And We had a lot of his friends from his church up in Los Angeles come down for the wedding and I had many friends from high school and college, they came to the wedding, and my mom and dad had several friends they had. So we probably had sixty or seventy people. I'm guessing. I don't...I don't remember exactly. We got a lot of very very nice wedding gifts and checks and things like that. The reception was in my parents' backyard, and my mom had planted a new tree back there to provide shade and to make it look attractive. We had a friend of my mom's bake the cake, so for, I think it was fifty dollars for the cake, and it was a beautiful cake, and we had  Jordan almond nuts and cake and punch at the reception. And that's what receptions were like in those days on a budget of five hundred dollars. So it was a very nice wedding. I made the table cloths. We...we did our own flower arrangements for the centerpieces of the tables and I think we set up a bunch of card tables in the backyard for the guests to sit at. After the wedding, my parents...a few people stayed later and that's when my parents actually put on ham, dinner, with potato salad and coleslaw. And my dad brought out his very best smoke cheese. And he had...I think they brought out some beer and probably hard liquor. I...I wasn't...I didn't drink much in those days so I didn't pay attention. They probably had beer and hard liquor because they didn't drink...I don't remember my parents drinking a lot of wine, so they probably didn't buy a lot of wine. So we partied until, probably from say one o'clock at the wedding and the reception and then the people stayed and then we drove up to Laguna beach. We're staying at Laguna beach hotel for our first night, and we got up there and had a very nice honeymoon and we spent one night in Laguna beach hotel, and the next day we drove to Big Bear, and we had rented a cabin from some friends of my husband  in Big Bear, so we stayed in the cabin and it was just kind of very romantic. We went down to the lake, and we drove around the Big Bear, and we prepared a lot of our own food cause we were still on a budget. I don't remember us eating out actually...at there...eating out at there, at Big Bear at all. I just kind of remember us preparing food that we brought. So we managed to  stay at Big Bear for three days. It was a lovely honeymoon, a lovely time. And...and then we came home and that was in June, and so we had the... I think I was...I was starting to teach summer school that summer. My husband still had to go back to school the next fall to finish his teaching credential and I had my teaching credential, so I started teaching summer school, and we felt like we were so rich. We had an apartment was a hundred dollars a month and it was furnished with furniture that was donated to us and we bought at garage sales and a lot of the lovely wedding gifts. We had...we didn't...I had a sterling set that my mom had been purchasing place setting since I was in high school, and every birthday or Christmas, she would buy...buy me a...a place setting of the sterling. So several people bought extra pieces of the sterling for our wedding gifts. And in fact I was just using a pop the other day, I thought oh we got this is a wedding gift, was a copper pop. And I still have some of the crystal candy dishes that we were given that it's time to actually give them away because I found my kids aren't interested in crystal candy dishes anymore. And we had...I member I got a recipe box that I still have upstairs. I haven't put recipes in it but the neighbor gave us a little wooden recipe box that was popular back in those days. Let's see. I'm trying to think some other gifts. Oh we got like a twenty five dollar gift certificate for now it was really a big deal to be able to go to the store and pick out something that we wanted with the gift certificate. I guess my parents were very happy that we were married. They had been wanting grandkids for a long time and so now it looks like they might, but it took them five years after we were married before they finally got grandchildren.",Normal,21,0,74.0,1.0,18.0,1242.0,360.0,89.0,69.0,20.0,28.0,127.0,16.0,0.289749798,0.991166078,3425,13316.0,1286.0,36.2,600.0,0.0965755482126765,0.46656298600311,0.028149300155521

We were been thinking about going to some place back east and starting a farm. Here came a a flyer and it said they had a house in Alpine available for twenty thousand dollars and we said hey that sounds pretty good. So we went and looked at it and ah I remember driving up with a realtor and she said well the best way to look at it would be from the backyard. Cause the front yard was too hard to park and stuff like that. So ah we got to the backyard and we looked at this house.  This is uh run downfield the   bunch of cars parked at the end of it. Couple tours and whatever and then this is her house it looked kind of weird right but nit had a stream stream bed run by it. So we looked at that and then it had this sound were much more like a we can make a farm out of it. This is gonna be kind of nice so we went down to the house and made across a bridge to get there and we looked at this house and it was merely a wreck. the bot bottom floor was uh ceiling was gone. The cover on the ceiling and the tile floor with all messed up and there was the upstairs was mended to somebody else so that we would only get the least bit at the beginning we would only get half the house. so ah but when miller went back with the realtor and looked it over again there was this huge sycamore tree and in three oaks four oaks something like that and we said yes we'll take it so we got this deal and this realtor he he gave us this second loan so we could make it because we were students at the time. We had no income. I had a GI bill. we were both TAs so we were getting a little bit of money that way. So we put down a down payment which I had from us when I used to work for the food and drug administration. I had twenty two thousand dollars down payment from uh retirement funds and we put that down and uh bought the house and spent the rest of the summer trying to get make it livable. The first thing we did was hih hih put a ceiling on the roof on the on the on the ceiling. so we bought cheap stuff and put it up there and held it in place and ah  bedroom place in stuff in and get a move our your friends to help us move into it.

3454_NormalText_INTERVIEW_ONLY_8-10-20.edited.txt," Well, I am going to talk about how I met my husband. I lived in the same apartment complex as he did in Atlanta. He had a very good job working for the environmental protection agency. I was working, teaching in the city, in a very challenging, low-income um sixth grade class. My students were, were um just naturally not in favor of each other, so they very often fought, physically fought and I wasn't, I wasn't used to that, so I guess it was about middle of October. I called my mother,  I told her, I called my mother and said you have to make time for me because I, I don_x0080__x0099_t know what to do. I, I'm not being successful in the classroom these kids can't read they want to fight all the time and I can't  teach discipline because  and I just don't know what to do I have to pay my, my car and pay for my rent and, and, and my mother said isn't it interesting when you went to the university of Minnesota you absorbed all that stuff about feeling sorry for people and excusing how about what I would call not acceptable behavior you always advocated for the underdog, and now you have the underdog, but you don't know what to do, so she said, come up with three things that you possibly can change. So, I thought about it, and I thought, well I got to take into consideration um that they want to fight. I have to have something there that they_x0080__x0099_ll all be successful at, and I have to find out something that will show that they need to respect me. So, I went in Monday morning and I moved all the desks so that two-thirds of the rooms were desks and my desk, and the whole third of the room, the back of the room was totally empty. So, they came in and they certainly noticed that the room was set up differently. So, I said, I am not, I_x0080__x0099_m not really comfortable with this fighting, but I understand that you need to fight, so I set up a place for you to fight. If you feel the need to fight, you just go to the back of the room and fight. The problem is, if any of the rest of you turn around and look, you will be fined 1 hour after school on Friday. So, there you go. That's the first rule. So, they could fight if they want to. The second is that you must be respectful of your uh your classmates, which means well, one of them is talking, you will not talk, and you must also be respectful of me, which means when I am talking, you will not talk. So, did they understand each other? They did. Well, it didn_x0080__x0099_t take very long before the first fight occurred, and I remember one of the boys_x0080__x0099_ names is uh, Ian, he went to the back of the room and you know, the other kids just didn't turn around at all, they didn't want to spend an hour after school on Friday and so, believe it or not, the fighting stopped and, the respect for me and other students um came through loud and clear. They could be all be successful with that and when I, when I figured out that these children had never been read to, had a very poor understanding of English literature, I started reading to them a half an hour in the morning and then they would want me to read on and on and on so I_x0080__x0099_d say, well if they don't have any discipline problems if no fights occur, I can read another 15 minutes. So basically, it worked. I, I, I, they got to hear a lot of books and their behavior improved remarkably. I think that_x0080__x0099_s all.  Um, I read, I read to them, one of the books I read was the great Gilly Hopkins, which was about bullying and about a girl whose mother had, had abandoned her. Um, I read a misfortune um  what's, what_x0080__x0099_s that word where black people who were heroes um, I think I got another one about an animal, um, I can't remember, but basically, they were where kids would find out some of the stories were the same situations they were and that person had to make a decision. Hopefully the stories modeled the decisions I wanted them to make.

3455_NormalText_INTERVIEW_ONLY_08-05-20.edited.txt," All right well, just in general, I, I was a baseball player and I, I played on, on my college team and uh I was uh not, I was, I was not a first stringer I was, I was on the bench most of the time um, but on a particular day I got in the game, and I got to first base somehow and the batter hit a, hit a line drive that was I could perceive was just about at the second basement but the ball was going to hit kind of right at his feet and if the ball hit the ground, then I should get to second base. If the ball didn't hit the ground, I should return to first base. What you don't want to do is, is try to figure it out to do, and do nothing, sit there and try to figure it out. So, I perceived that the ball would be caught, and I turned and dove back into first base and it turned out the ball bounced, and, and there wasn't any play at first base but anyway as I picked myself up my, my, my left shoulder was, was not functioning so I, so I walked towards the bench and the coach could see that, that I was injured, and they said  almost immediately you dislocated your shoulder so, so I, it did hurt and it was, and it was, you totally couldn't rotate your elbow or anything. They took me to the training room the trainers tried to reinsert it and if you reinsert it quickly it gets easier otherwise the muscles tighten up and, and they prevent you from, from putting it back in place. They couldn't get it in, they had, they were, they were hurting me, but  they couldn_x0080__x0099_t get it in, so they, they determined that I needed to go to the hospital. I went to a hospital um, I was in a lot of pain uh, uh, they, they looked at me. I, they, they determined that they would have to put me under general anesthetic to um, to get it, get the muscles to relax enough to replace them. Um, am I, am I slow enough or fast enough, I_x0080__x0099_m okay?  First time ever and uh, so as I recall they just wheeled me up to a room and, and gave me a general anesthetic. I don't remember whether it was the old-fashioned kind like ether or gas or whether it was a newer kind like , but um, and, and when I woke, I felt um of course the arm was all bandaged up, motionless, and uh and I felt rather intoxicated and the only time in my life they took me into the recovery room before I was able to get on my feet and there was, there was a young man twenty years old and the nurses were young ladies and I thought it was pretty cool that I was, I was getting all their attention and um uh, and I remember at one point when they all walked out of the room, I mean not, not as though that was some problem, but there wasn_x0080__x0099_t anybody there and I was frustrated that I didn't have anybody to talk to. Now, I am not a blabby person and that's not how I feel in general. I am quite happy by myself, but at this time under, under that influence of whatever they gave me, it was very hard I wanted somebody to come back into the room so I could impress them. And um.  There was somebody driving me.  I think they made sure that I got to the uh to the room where they uh determine what was wrong with me.  Well, I am trying to think if I was twenty-one years old um, I was either twenty or twenty-one I can hardly say that, but no there was nobody contacted on my behalf.  It was the University of Southern California <and I> uh, uh it_x0080__x0099_s in, it_x0080__x0099_s in right in the middle of Los Angeles.  No, I_x0080__x0099_m from San Diego.

Ah, that_x0080__x0099_s, that_x0080__x0099_s a little bit hard to answer. I used to play a lot of volleyball and when I tried to spike with my left arm it would hurt and that_x0080__x0099_s the only circumstance under which, that I ever had any residual problem with that shoulder and, and I, I felt like a time or two that I had instantaneously kicked it out of its socket, and it slipped right back,  little bit of soreness, but never, it never would dislocate to stay out.

I was in my thirties. late twenties early thirties. well, I I remember how how strenuous it was we would I was hiking with two other gentlemen and we would we would try to do fifteen steps up the mountain there was no trail or anything we were just going up the side of the mountain it was that we know the way we motivated ourselves you know let's do fifteen steps and then we'll rest. and then, we rest for a few minutes and then we do another fifteen steps y'know I just slowly in increments work towards the top of that mountain.

3461_NormalText_INTERVIEW_ONLY_02-26-2021.edited.txt," I'm talking about a time when when my past husband moved from New York City to San Diego. My parent were already in San Diego and I was gonna go to use to uhm Berkeley to school. So, I'm gonna focus on it was a long trip and we bought we actually bough a sort of van that looked like a bus to ravel in and with us came two of our good friends came along for the ride and to to help driving. And uhm it was a little challenging because of the weather and it was a long drive. We drove to the south and when we got to Texas, all of a sudden, we were near in a near a small area uhm on highway 10 interstate 10 and the bus just stopped working and we had to of course, those days we didn't have cellphones so, we had we were like 40 miles from a town now I can't think of something in western Texas and we had to wait until a highway patrol person came or some kinda maybe they. And so, we called to have us we had to be towed to the town of Fort Stockton and we ended up spending 2 days there where they tried to fix it and they couldn't get it fixed and we ended up renting a big U-haul cuz we had we also had our car that we people took driving and to take the car and all our possessions to San Diego. And during that time, our two friends didn't just want to wait around a couple days so they took our car or they too had a rented car and they drove all they way down to Big Ben national park and back just to see it. Have I used up my time or should I go on? Yes, I was 27.  Yes. I wasn't supposed to I was supposed to scheduled to start the following September but we decided go to stay in San Diego, my parents lived there and get acclimated to the California and I worked. Once we got there, I was able to get a job. The field I was the field I was gonna study was master's in library sciences and become a full librarian but I had been working in library as sort of a they called them a library assistant. Before New York, I had already taken the year of studies. Hard time because I was working at Queen's college which also had a library science program. So, I was I looked for a job in San Diego and I got one working first at southwestern college, that was only part time, and then at San Diego State University where I became a library assistant. The end of the story is that while I worked at San Diego State, I became interested in computer science in libraries and I ended up not going to Berkeley to get my degree but working there and being there I got into the computer field where I ended up working there until I retired 2006. *unintelligible* I can fill in more. Yea. So, they decided that it was the engine that broke it. I think that we were just pushing it a little bit and it was an old it was like 15, 20 years old. So, we ended up renting a big U-haul and just uhm. yea, including the car. I wonder how I don't remember if our friends rented something.

It was a brand new hotel and that particular date set all records for heat so it was a apparently about a hundred and ten degrees outside and the air conditioning broke in the brand-new hotel so it was quite warm but  nonetheless I remember parts of the the wedding specifically, my husband rushing to say instead of saying I do he was told to say yes and he said yes three to the answer to the question of the officiate it prematurely before he was supposed to . So it made for a chuckly for everybody. We had about seventy-five people there. We had a rabbi who was officiating although my family's not Jewish  but that was in deference to my husband's family, and I remember my father not wanting to wear a yamaka because he didn't believe in organized religion so that created a bit of a stir. But I I remember one guest in particular who showed up with the same dress as another guest and we felt awkward but turned it around and and she later told me that she said what to this other woman you have very very good taste so she made she made something positive out of something that could have been negative. When the wedding was over we I changed out of my wedding dress and my husband and I were were going to leave well we left the place where the actual wedding had taken place the reception had taken place and it was a multi-level parking garage and he forgot where he parked the car so in the hundred- and ten-degree weather we went all over the parking garage it almost ended our marriage before it started. But here we are fifty-three years later and still together, so I guess it worked out okay. How much time do I have left?  Okay yeah I had it was a formal wedding so the men including my husband and the the best men best man I guess it was one person wore tuxedoes and the the women had they were a couple of brides maids my college roommate's and they all wore matching dresses which I know is no longer the case they don't do that very often but this goes back fifty-three years my dress was a formal long white dress and had lace overlay and I had a veil. We subsequently stored it it had it dry cleaned and stored it in my mother's attic and then the attic got so hot we had to throw the dress away because it burned it it it got scorched.

I'd already...I was about between eighteen and nineteen years old, and I already moved out and was on my own, had a roommate and was trying to earn a living and go to college and pay my own way, and things got so tight that I needed to move back in with my parents, but it wasn't a happy home and so I had gotten in argument with my father, and I was pretty rebellious at that time. I had a lot of hard feelings toward them and he's just started arguing, but of course as things typically did, they escalated and he started to hit me, but I remember really is getting into a ball, putting my hands over my head and getting into a ball and he made comments about my boyfriend. He often the topic of me and boys were taboo...very taboo. And...and so they got under his skin and so he just started making almost sexualized comments while he's hitting me, and he said he's going to start using his fists. And so I got really scared, and I ran out of the house, and he came running after me down the street. So I running down the street. I'm pretty fast, but I'm still young, and he's faster, so I ran pass my neighbors, I knew them, and pass the next neighbors, I knew them, and then by the time he was catching up with me, I was at a neighbor's house that we weren't really friendly with. I knew who they were. They had a daughter, kind of my age, and a daughter close to my sister's age. So I knew them, but what we're Jewish, and they weren't particular...they think we were racist. And so they weren't particularly friendly to us. It put on airs and they just acted not...wasn't a friendly home that I would have gone to, but I knew my dad was catching...catching up with me, and before I could get to the next house where there were other Jewish family, I ran into their house and luckily their door was unlocked, so I ran in and I sat down in a chair, and the lady was on the couch, and she didn't know what was going on and she started asking me but the...by that time my dad came in, and he just came right into and he grabbed my arm in front of the lady, and she was telling him ""No Albert. No, no, no."" And he said ""No, I'm taking her"", and...and she didn't, she save me. She didn't let me go. She didn't let me go, and my sister...I call my sister. I'm the youngest in the family so she's, living on her own. And she came and got me. She came and picked me up, and I stayed with her for the next while. I don't really remember how I got back on my feet, but I just remember she came and got me. I don't even really remember what I was wearing. I just remember...I remember that we started...my father and I started arguing about business. He started arguing about capitalism and how, this was during the sixties, so how capitalism was using people and make profit off of people and...and my father was in sales and how salesman you know just wanted to get their coin across and wanna make the sale and they really didn't care what happened to the person. Guess where I was coming to work as a salesman and he said you know I don't do that and I said all salesman do that, and that's what escalated it.

3521_NormalText_INTERVIEW_ONLY_02-03-21.edited.txt," Okay, well I was uh twenty three years old when I found out I was pregnant with my first child. My sister had already had a child three months before and I was very anxious to have one that could play with her child. so we were very excited. Uh the day of the delivery, um it was a wonderful, no, I had no idea had no problems with pregnancy at all. Uh, the day, but my husband was a little concerned about how we were going to get to the hospital because it was several miles away. so he asked that I please have the baby on a sunday morning so that there would be not much traffic, but before church let out. so on the day before I had worked and I informed my boss that that was the last saturday I was going to work. I just, was too tired and I was too pregnant. so sunday morning all of a sudden I realized my water had broken. This was about three in the morning, but I knew I had to wait until church was in session. so we kinda sat around and I timed everything and so about eleven o'clock we headed over to the hospital made it before church was out and then I walked up to the delivery room because being on sunday nobody was really around and when I got up there they looked at me askance and said you're supposed to house a a a wheelchair wheel you out you're not supposed to walk up here by yourself. And ya know, I did, and saw the doctor and the doctor had been up all night long delivering babies. And so he looked at me and since it was the first baby and he didn't think anything was that important he said, I've got to, OH! first he sat down in the chair next to me and my husband was still out in the other room and uh funny I kinda said can my husband come in and he said oh yeah and he said I think I'm gonna go home and get a little sleep. I said okay I guess it will be here for a while. I say it because at that time we didnt know what sexs were before the baby was born. so he yeah he uh he toddled off and went to get his nap and my husband came in at about twenty minutes later, all of a sudden I was pushing hard and the nurses saying I think this baby's coming I think I better call the doctor. so she called him but he had already gotten home so he had, ya know, no cell phones at that time, so he uh turned around and came back but in the meantime i'd think i'd probably thought you know I think this nurse is old enough that she probably had more experience than the doctors. So I really wasn't concerned if he didn't make it, but uh he did and I was going to have a spinal. so he uh prepped me for all of that and if I had to wait until I was really pushing and then they would put the spinal in. and I say that because when I had my third child I knew what was coming I knew that were gonna be some hard pushes, so, I kind of cheated and said I was having a hard one be, and had them put the final and a little bit early. anyhow, she came out just fine, but in that, at that time they didn't allow fathers into the room. So I had to talk to him over the loudspeaker to say you have a little girl, which I know he was very happy with the baby but he really wanted a little boy. but anyhow, he had a girl and uh so it was uh, uh, it was very very nice. course the doctors, oh! and then the doctor said oh he said you're lucky he said now in order to get your milk coming in he said you can drink all the beer you want because that'll help your milk. and I remember saying to him but I don't like beer, hahaha. It didn't make any difference to him, he thought it was a good idea. I think he drank plenty of beer. Um, but then I went back and everything was ok until the next morning when I had one of those spinal headaches and that was not pleasant. But the rest of it was very nice, so, I uh, so I decided I would have a second one. And then uh we have another little girl, so then I decided okay we gotta try for that boy one more time. So, and when we moved to San Diego, I got pregnant and we did have a boy. And I happened to be going to a doctor who was a catholic and when I asked for birth control he said, I don't just prescribe birth control and he says you have babies so easy. He said, why don't you want more babies? And so I went to a new doctor. And uh, that was it. I  three children, they're all old. I now have grandchildren and no great grandchildren. But I remember that as one of the highlights of my early adulthood because I think it, having a child changes your entire life your whole entire looked out on life.

It was Arizona college it was called then to major in forestry and it got very cold in the winter and there was a bunch of buddies I had that were troublemakers I was uh I wasn't a troublemaker myself but I'd certainly joined in when people were off for making trouble and Bill Tilly was the lead troublemaker and he is renamed Butch. Said to us hey let's have some fun in the snow here the the campus was frozen over everything covered with snow and he said follow me I got an idea and we went outside and in the streets of the campus and when a car would come through the campus he would have us crouched down uh behind bush and when the car came up to stops sign he_x0080__x0099_d motion and we_x0080__x0099_d all grab onto the back bumper the car and slide around in slide when the car took off from the stop sign we would start sliding and we we really enjoyed that had a lot of fun and we started getting good at it because sometimes cars might figure out they were there and they_x0080__x0099_d speed up or try to make us fall and we_x0080__x0099_d laugh and tumble and uh go crazy and the ah had a heating system in a campus caused all the places where the heating system across the street to be about a two and a half three feet of asphalt the melted snow and so we had to have someone sit on the trunk of the car we wo_x0080_¦ we went in after we got bored jumping on us of people just driving by we went and got our own car and uh it was my car in fact and we would one person would sit on the trunk of the car while whole bunch of people would be on the back bumper and he would yell steam tunnel at just the time it was coming and we'd all learn to dis you know pump our feet up and down really fast instead of trying to slide and if we did it right the um we would get past the steam tunnel and if you didn't do it right it would just it you'd stick and it_x0080__x0099_d just smack you on the ground but we thought it was a great challenge to do that so we did that for quite a while and then Bill Tilly says okay I've got the ultimate uh challenge now ah let's go and then we followed him. he was he was insane.  Um route sixty six comes right by the Arizona State College campus now called Northern Arizona University and um there_x0080__x0099_s a to get acro_x0080_¦ to to the to get across route sixty six there's a just like is is here you push a button and it causes the light to turn red among traffic going on si through sixty six. So first we_x0080__x0099_d push the button. Cross the street and then uh uh uh waited the light turned green and then we_x0080__x0099_d push the button again like we're gonna go back across street but no he would say when the cars would stop we would run and get on the last car that was stacked up on line and we_x0080__x0099_d take off down route sixty six because it was frozen over too. And we_x0080__x0099_d go to two guys to a car two guys to a bumper cause there_x0080__x0099_d often be you know two lanes going each way so we_x0080__x0099_d have four guys on two on each bumper and sometimes maybe three and we_x0080__x0099_d go sliding down route sixty six yelling and screaming and racing each other and is route sixty six leaves flagstaff it curves around toward whims and that's when we would let go and slide off into a snowbank and then cross the street and go back and do it over again and this went this went on for about twenty minutes and was just incredibly fun and crazy. We could have all been killed and and all of sudden from every direction highway patrol campus police um um sheriff's re re red lights in every direction Bill Tilly yell yells every man for himself and i took off running behind the dairy queen. most of the guy in fact all the guys got caught except except me and I took off running from the dairy queen, a cop chased me in his car on this bacon field and um but he when we came to a railroad track that had a deep thing he couldn't get over in his car so he got out started chasing me and so right nearby after I got over the railroad track there was an abandoned armory and it was dark inside I went inside the armory and I went down to the end of it and I saw his shadow come in vain he says I know you're in I'm gonna get you and I slowly but surely went up this old wooden stairs and into a room and he figured out that I had gone upstairs he had a flashlight and I crouched down in this room and when I crouched down and my I started adjusting to the darkness I noticed there was rats every place and they started running over my shoes.  I was totally freaked out it was horrible. he came upstairs I could hear him coming he was shining his out his light in each room and he shined the light in the room that I was in but I was crouched down behind a desk and he didn't see me and he left and I was the only guy that didn't get caught and all other guys got in big trouble. they had the paint all the curbs on a campus in the spring thaw and they were on probation and every time that I would hang out with them they_x0080__x0099_d yell they_x0080__x0099_d yell at the cops that came in the restaurant we were reading hey this guy should have gotten caught too and they they_x0080__x0099_d rat me out and that's the story and all true all frickin.

So we weren't able to talk to him or hold him for several days until his body temperature uh increased and we were concerned what caused it obstetrician or pediatrician who attended said this sometimes happens with children and uh it's not to worry about as long as it normalizes. The other thing i remember is that he had toes his toes hooked down the way mine do and those are called hammer toes and the altitude the pediatrician commented that that that was another hereditary characteristics and we named him Evan James Richman and took him home in a few days and it was a wonderful experience. Have we covered 5 minutes yet?

President Eisenhower and uh he was also heavier than Russell. one of the issues in children is you know how soon they roll over and they're more mobile and Evan was too heavy to roll over and Russell had a much smaller body and he rolled over quickly and my brother in law called him chrome dome.

Um and I obviously passed it and surprisingly um pass the test  and got called in to the police chief's office for an interview which was very interesting because um he asked me a lot of questions and one of them was why do you want to be a police officer. And I said well because i think it's helpful.  I would be helping people.  And he slammed his fist on the desk, made me jump, and said _x0080__x009c_well if that's what you want, you need the go apply to the welfare department and become a welfare worker._x0080__x009d_  And so i went back to my desk and thought _x0080__x009c_well I blew that._x0080__x009d_  And an hour or so later i was called and and said i was hired and that really changed my life and i went um to the police academy and there were um  fifty two men in the police academy and me.  And um that was quite an experience.  I went through all the training, including the physical training.  Some of the things we had to do was climb a rope from the floor to the ceiling in that gym where we were being trained  and do physical um training and they thought that because i was a woman i should be doing the physical training with a guy so they brought a woman and to be my partner in the physical training and unfortunately um i've always been really strong and i broke her wrist and then they gave me they gave up and let me train with the guys. That was one uh interesting experience and i graduated uh from the police academy.  I was number eight out of fifty two guys and i was pretty pleased with uh_x0080_¦ when they hired women, the six women that were originally hired um we were required to have two years of college to qualify.  The guy's only had to have high school.  Another interesting thing that happened, they made me sit out in the hall when they discuss birth birthing cause police officers sometimes had to deliver babies in the in the cars if someone you know was in labor and was not driving down the street and didn_x0080__x0099_t make it to the hospital.  So but they because i was a woman in there they thought the men would be too embarrassed to to say anything in front of me so they made me sit in the hall.  But all in all, the women were made detectives originally.  We were not on the street.  We were not in uniform and many people ask do um  were we discriminated against then.  Well no i don't think we were.  The police officers on the street were pleased to have  us do what we did.  I remember one guy had um there were about six uniformed officers trying to put one woman in the back of a police car to go to jail and they weren_x0080__x0099_t making it. She was all teeth and fingernails and and they couldn't get her in the car.  Well I didn't have a problem.  I got her in the car and i had to sit on her all the way to jail_x0080_¦ to keep her down.

My parents were not accepting that I was getting older. And uh when I was nineteen and a half, uh, I had met a young man  into a friendship. My parents were aghast I was way too young for that, and uh um they kind of pretty much locked me up. I mean I went to work but that was it. I couldn't go anywhere, couldn't do anything, and I resented that a great deal that friendship did not break up and I was looking forward to this twenty-first birthday because then I would be free to do as I pleased. I would be of age. So I had to go to work that morning. I work for a German airline, Lufthansa, and uh, so I looked at the alarm clock and it wasn't quite time to get up yet.

And um all of the sudden the lights in my room went on, and I see in the doorway my mother and my father in their nightgowns coming toward me and I mean that was totally unusual, something that never happened. I assumed that they were there to wish me happy birthday after all this was turning twenty one the big twenty one, and instead my mother said i just wanted to tell you that your father's not your father. Then she collapsed, my dad kind of scooped her off the ground and, uh, let her back out then turned off the lights and the door closed. And here was. Here was there it's like, WHAT? My father's not my father?  man I_x0080__x0099_ve grown up with is not my father? There was no question about this, I was totally, it was like somebody hit me over the head.

I put on some  and a sweater or whatever and uh then I had to walk uh to the bus. I, it was an hour bus ride to the uh to the airport. i'm sitting in the bus and i'm looking out it's still dark, the lights are on outside uh street lights and all this. and I'm looking out there and I feel totally lost because everything was upside down. I was um =internet interference=  about their normal daily activities, now getting on the bus going to work or whatever that felt totally out of sorts. Um, and went to, got there. I just didn't know what to do. If I went to the bathroom, down the hall I looked in the mirror and I looked at myself. I, so my father's not my father. But everybody is saying I look like him. How can I look like him if he's not my father? Who is my father? Have I ever met this guy? Who is he? Where was he ever in my life at all? Maybe now he was the grocer on the street or something, I didn't know.

3574_NormalText_INTERVIEW_ONLY_9-11-20.edited (1).txt," Let_x0080__x0099_s see now. It was where, it was a uh, we just , my dad had just gotten his uh deer license, and he got one for me. So, we were heading up for the mountains and we got into, we found the perfect spot that, it was flat, plenty of  areas. And within that, we , or we had that thing, so we had to figure out how to build some, build it a uh a place to sleep cause we were gonna be there for three or four nights. We were right near a stream so we could fish. So, we came up, my dad asked me to figure out something. The only thing I could think of was to build a frame, so I built a box frame and I took a lot of pine leaves through the pine, through the pine leaves over the branches, left a hole in the, the box that I made. It was about uh, seven foot long, three-foot-wide um four foot wide and about three foot high, I couldn_x0080__x0099_t go any higher than that. So, it was more of a, it was more just a, a place for uh sleeping bags to go, when they go in there and sit and enjoy yourself. And, kept it up with the pine, pine  and everything else on the ground, first, and then we put the sleeping bags, laid them out through the hole. And, once I had everything put together from the , basically, I used everything that was laying on the ground. I didn_x0080__x0099_t have to tear anything up. I just found dead, dead poles and everything, so I just used what was there because we didn_x0080__x0099_t really have any saws or anything else or, we had a hand axe, but that_x0080__x0099_s not gonna do much damage. Once we had it all finished, it started to snow, so I finished it in just in about a right amount of time, and after we had finished it, we went off to the creek and my dad was fishing, and I went to look for a rabbit. And I saw the rabbit, and that evening, we sat down and we had potatoes, fish, and rabbit, and  the trip we forgot, we forgot to have uh, we forgot to get any, bring any flowers home when we were frying fish, but then, we had a bunch of crackers. So, I just crumbled the crackers up and that was our breading for the fish. And we had fried potatoes, fried fish, and fried rabbit. And then, by that time, it was too wet, so we had to get in, into the  and spend the rest of the night and then, real good time. We enjoyed it. That_x0080__x0099_s not five minutes though.  Uh, the fish we filleted. And  was trout, so you know, on the trout, what we did there, we did, we, well we gutted it, we just cut it in half. Trout, you always cooked it with the fish head on, and you also fish, cooked it with the  on, so slice it in half or you could just fry it complete, but we sliced it in half and made this one half down, skin side up,  it was really good. The rabbit, we used uh when we , when we cut it, we spread it, and it was more like, just like a chicken. Same idea as a chicken, and we had the, the breast, and the , mostly the breast and the ribs, and we fried that as well. We had a little bit of, little bit of grease, and we did have some salt and pepper.  with it, I know the, the, the potatoes we had was, we always boiled potatoes before we left, so that they would , so they were already cooked and they were easy to fry. And of course, the boiled potatoes really made it nice cause like it, there was  potato if you wanted to, you could take one or two potatoes with you when you were out walking, but, and then, the next day, next day we had the river. We were walking, we were walking around the, we met a gentleman that had this  the,  the deer, and he didn_x0080__x0099_t like the, he didn_x0080__x0099_t like the live, the live, the liver, so he left it up in a tree and my dad said, _x0080__x009c_We_x0080__x0099_ll take it if you don_x0080__x0099_t._x0080__x009d_ So, we took it and that evening, we had fried liver without the onions, which makes it kind of, kind of tacky, but liver and onions are always good, but liver with potatoes, it was good.

At that time, once you were on the field, you stayed on the field. There is no substitution, except on third down. On fourth down you could substitute a punter and a picker. So I played both offense and defense. It was a very tight game, went back and forth. And we had to lead a good bit of the game, but also Alabama had to lead. And...at...towards the end of the game, we...we made a very long run about eighty yards by Ernie xx, a good friend of mine. And...and we scored and so we took the lead. And we were seventeen to fourteen. Alabama with Joe Namath made a very fierce drive. They drove down to our goal line and I got a first down on our one yard line, and they did not score. They didn't get in. And after the game, there was a rumor going. The reporters found in the Alabama room, this gala report and that's...and this gala report from Alabama's...among other things said do not run towards number eighty, which was me.

3601_NormalText_INTERVIEW_ONLY_3-25-2021edited.txt," Okay hi. I was a graduate student and just one year of graduate study, and I was going out with a guy, also in the same program, and I really was in love you know? I was twenty years old, and I, no I had turned twenty one just before I went, and I was away from home. But that was fine because I didn_x0080__x0099_t wanna be a home. And so, you know, we were pushing the boundary back then. You got to realize, I_x0080__x0099_m seventy nine, they didn't have the pill commonly available they pretty much just had, um, (x) hahaha, here is a good illustration of uh, the problem i'm up against trying to think of words. Um, oh my goodness, uh what men knew, um I can't think. Hahah. Anyway you know what I mean. Um, and he didn_x0080__x0099_t like like using them, funny I can't think of the name right now, I haven_x0080__x0099_t thought about word for a little while and so you know, I knew kinda go by the rhythm method and I, I know exactly when it happened. In retrospect, at the time I thought, I_x0080__x0099_m fine, you know? And so we made love and then about three weeks later I'm feeling really awful in the morning, and you know I thought oh my goodness I_x0080__x0099_ve got a flu. I got some kind of bug going around. And sure enough, I did go to the doctor. He put me through my first pelvic exam, which was very much a shock, you know? I just hahah just had never been in anything like this. And I_x0080__x0099_m like uh, and then the shock even more was to find out I was pregnant. I hadn_x0080__x0099_t even entertain that idea. I had not. I was academically advanced, but in terms of you know biology i suppose you could say, or in terms of certain, uh, avoiding pregnancy I was pretty much of a, maybe a double thinking really. Because I knew I was inviting trouble. I had been really frightened down a few formal occasions because it was so scandalous if you were not married. But anyway, I was just, I mean if I (x) little, a little ill before I felt. I just remember that day April Twenty-three Nineteen Sixty Three, and ha, and I was so, um, just like sick to my stomach by the prospect that I had wanted to wait about five years before I would do what was considered and always presented in my background as the duty of a woman. You know? But I really hadn't really other than doing baby sitting, I hadn't really had a lot of of contact with, with small children. I wasn't particularly turned on by the idea, I mean not at. I really didn't want to become a mother, but I hadn't thought too much about it. It was just one of those things that was like it happens. And so I was very distressed, but I did know I was going to stay with this man. And um, and so that was not an issue that was not like awe here I am all alone, and you know there was no issue that way. So the funny thingm and the reason why I decided to talk about this particular incident is that my son was totally a-a disaster for me at that time. Um, something I didn't want, something that totally changed my life. And my husband was not interested, well I'm saying husband, but at that time we weren_x0080__x0099_t married. And he was not interested at all. He had a two and a half year old that he had, really had abandoned from a first marriage and he was not much of a father type let's put it that way. Um, and then the next thing was I had to get married and of course I could not tell my parents, we were staunch New England puritan types. And so it was only after my baby was born, away from home, that I told them. And it was considered a disgrace for a while.  you know my father in particular. So it was a very inauspicious beginning, and i really feel that because my my my my outlook was so negative about being a mother. Um and also uninterested i wouldn't say in the process it was quite interesting seeing the child and seeing how it develops. But I, in the day to day  it was a pain and I really was not thrilled and I didn't get much help. But in retrospect, and this is why i was thinking today about gratitude. Because even though it was an accident, and very traumatic at the time. It was one of the best things that could have happened because if i had, and if the pill was available shortly afterwards you know pretty much to all everywhere, and I, I would have taken the pill. And I would have gone on to have a career and than I, I would have said especially in view of my husband's indifference, Oh I guess we don't have to have a child. And it would have been like that and i would not have a child. And now I have him, and we have a reasonable relationship politically or religiously different, but we do have a caring relationship. And um, I have four grandchildren from him and I just had a great grandchild, and you know and when you say what are the sources of happiness even though they don't live nearby. Um, that's it. That's the biggest source of happiness for me, sorry hahahahaha.

So I was twenty-six years old and my wife and my brother and I were leading a group of college students on a bus tour from Frankfurt, Germany to New Delhi India and as we were driving through eastern Iran uh we uh allowed one of the students one other the the college students to drive one of the buses and she got into an accident with a farmer's cart on the road. Uh so this was out in the middle of nowhere basically although it was a good road and it was on a Friday which is the Muslim sabbath and Iran is a Muslim country so um you know all the usual things that might be going on during the week were not going on. So um pretty soon people were coming out of the fields and surrounding our bus and it was like a holiday for them while like an entertainment uh they were amazed to see all these Americans um uh you know standing around and um so they kind of wanted to be entertained and so one of the one of the students one of the uh farmers had a donkey and they convinced one of the students to get on it  and start riding around and they were cheering and yelling and so forth and uh one of the farmers spoke some English so he suggested that we take the good bus in two shifts and drive into the little village and from there we could contact the authorities to come out and investigate the axe and do the paperwork so we could keep moving. The farmer's cart was a little damaged but our buses were not. So we did that we got into the village and some local um uh military I guess they were ah we reported to them and they said well we have to have the some patrol which I guess is the equivalent of the highway patrol here had to come out and so in the meantime the village people we we went to a little restaurant we were eating and then they look some of the village people invited us to their homes ah afterward for some tea and sweets. So that was very nice um and so the day is going on and on and and then our translator are unofficial translator tells us we say what's going on ya know nobody's coming is it because it's the sabbath and he said no the military guys want a bribe so I got really mad um and so what the translator suggested was that we go into a nearby larger town and speak to I don't know what they would be the equivalent of but they were kind of like the local constabulary so I guess they were like the the the police department. So we went in there and we spoke to them and they said uh they contacted this highway patrol and the highway patrol said that the army had never contacted them so they were just sitting around waiting for a bribe. So uh the so the police said they would contact the highway patrol and have them come out. So within an hour the highway patrol arrived and it turned out that uh we need to have our document xerox but it was the sabbath no one could operate a xerox machine which was located in the second story of the local pharmacy so we had to stay overnight but it was it was a camping trip so we didn't mind that so much. So um the uh we didn't trust the military at that point and the military said we will uh put you  up on our base not really a base but their headquarters whatever it was. So the military were kind of smiling and and I don_x0080__x0099_t know they just looked suspicious. So before the highway patrol left they said hey we don't trust these guys we think they're going to ah you know not not we don't think they have our best interests at heart. So um all of a sudden this guy steps out of the crowd that was around there speaks perfect English um and he says to us uh if you would like to stay at my place you can all camp in my yard so we said ok absolutely and the highway patrol approved of this so he had this big beautiful villa I mean kind of a villa especially for that area um so he let us stay in his yard um and the next morning we woke up we had food and water and things like that for ourselves so we had breakfast.

So, two days before we were to uh go to the train to head up to Los Angeles to take the oath. we went into the barbershop and and got a significantly short haircut because we knew that thatÕs that thatÕs what they would do then we would have at least a decent haircut rather than the shaved job that they give you. So, we did and then the next day we uh got a uh ride down to the uh train station downtown San Diego and we got on a train with a bunch of other guys that were heading up to the uhm uhm the recruiting office I guess it was up in Los Angeles and we arrived there they took us by bus drove us over to this building and then told us to go up to this floor and into it was about twenty-five or thirty of us. So, they lined us all up in four different lines and they read us what we were supposed to know about the going into the service and uh the very last thing they said was that if each one of you take a step forward, that means that you have decided that you're going to go in and and accept the ah being a member of whatever service they were going to send us to and I thought in my mind Òwhat if I don't want to take that, what's gonna happen?Ó but I already knew I would be in trouble. So, all of us there took a step forward and we uh accepted the uh being drafted into the service and then a uh they said okay em we're going to take you by bus right down to the train station again weÕre going to send you all up to fort billboard not answer for not fort billboard, thatÕs where I went later ah uhm mmm what was the name of that?

I, my grandma, I grew up in Philadelphia and my grandmother lived in Virginia Beach, and I was in college, and I decided I wanted to go on a vacation by myself without my family. So, I thought, well maybe to make it more comfortable, I would do this in Virginia Beach where my grandmother was, but I would not stay with her. I_x0080__x0099_d, I_x0080__x0099_d get a motel. So, I did that, and, and I was in the motel watching the moon landing on television, and it was late at night on the east coast. It was, I think it was like one am, and I had always been interested in the space program growing up. I would watch all the launches that they had previously where they were just going into orbit, and I was fascinating. I would be late to school cause I was watching a, a, a launch ah so anyway, I was in this motel and I had been trying to stay awake. I went outside, I walked to the amusement park, walked around there. I started to get hungry, so I bought a, a little mini pizza and took it back to my hotel, and you know, watch some of the preparations for the landing and all that, and then I fell asleep. I suddenly just woke up and uh Neil Armstrong was just coming down the ladder onto the surface of the moon. I was so glad that I woke up to see that, so I watched it for a while and uh, that was the highlight of, of my little mini vacation. I uh, I just, I was, this motel was at the beach, and so I_x0080__x0099_d go to the beach during the day and then I_x0080__x0099_d go to my grandmother_x0080__x0099_s house for dinner, sat, satisfied her.

This was what, nineteen sixty-nine?  Uh, I don't remember the day.  Actually, you know, now that I said the date, nineteen sixty-nine, I realized I had already graduated in sixty-eight.  At the university, Temple University in Philadelphia, and so yeah and sixty-nine, I had graduated and it was the next year that I came to San Diego.  It was, it was nice and it just felt good being an adult, not going where my parents take me or anything and um, it just made me feel grown up.  Uh, not too much. They wanted me to stay with my grandmother, but I was always independent. I just said, _x0080__x009c_No I'm gonna get a motel._x0080__x009d_ I was surprised how much the motels cost.

3633_NormalText_INTERVIEW_ONLY_1-13-21.edited.txt,I worked for a very long time. Thirty-six years to be exact for the San Diego police department. I was not a an officer. I was a civilian and I work in a number of different uh um positions on the department. What I'm going to talk about is an incident where I crashed in a basketball game and tore ligaments and cartilage in my leg. I was um a one of the a a very few civilians around the police team. The police team was mostly made up understandably by police officers because they do like make it that way. Anyway was in a we had a series of games one year and this particular game was against the Los Angeles police department's basketball team. This took place in new municipal gym here in San Diego. Um during the game um I were we were of course running up and down and I went up for a rebound came down with the ball and my left leg collapsed when I came down. So um I knew that I was in big trouble at the point and I laid down on my back and uh everyone came running of course they they knew that that there was gonna be a a pretty good injury. So they came out and I remember watching uh sports on tv and that sort of thing watching the the injured person stay out there for twelve minutes fifteen minutes and just kind of you know stop the whole show. I told them to take grab my hands and pull me off the court.   So a couple people grab my hands and just pulled me off the court and got me out of the way and that was my way of saying god get on with the game and let's get going. So uh I went home and um and a was helped to the car and my leg was hurting really bad but I could limp. So I went on and um  got so over the next three weeks I could start walking a little and then jogging a little. I then went out to my high school to play basketball not the smartest thing I've ever done and the first time I cut on it my leg collapsed and I said oh man I really have a problem here so at this point I had to go to the make an appointment to go to the doctor I went to the doctor a few days later and said you had they you have a bad injuryso they schedule surgery and they did surgery on my knee and on my  surgery on my knee um the doctor says would you like to watch the surgery and I said yes I'd love to watch it and so um I stood I could watch while he opened up my knee um tore told ligaments and put took staples and pounded them into my knee with a hammer just like very crude and when I told people about that afterwards they said oh you're kidding me you actually did that that. Yeah I actually did that so anyway um I uh uh that surgery got over and I um recovered from that and my basketball career uh got back in gear and I played basketball on full court until I was fifty seven years old and at that which point I had um open heart surgery because I had my heart was not working right. So another medical issue got involved but a that that's basically that incident.  My my recovery was about uh um two months what happened was my insurance did not cover rehab so I had to do the rehab at home by myself.   And I had two people who had the same injury the same day that had the same surgery and they had rehab and they go into rehab twice a week and the rehab there would would hold their hand and say everything's going fine where is at home I'd be home and just beating my leg to death going crazy so I'd walk in for follow ups at the same time as these other two gentlemen and I'd be way ahead of them in fact at one point after two months I could jog end of the class and into the appointment and both of them were still on crutches.

I was first interviewed with the army recruiter and then a while they were grading those tests I made my way over to the nuclear ah submarine uh excuse me the nucleur Navy department and uh which roused my curiosity a lot because I have had some nuclear training and I swore in as a uh as a to be enlisted into the navy. It was about six months later that ah I was given the opportunity of being interviewed by admiral Rickover in Washington DC and on that particular day I was interviewed by three officers throughout the day took about an hour for each one of them to interview me and that was followed after lunch by a personal interview with admiral Rickover. I had heard much about those interviews of Rickover he he took on the responsibility of interviewing all officers that go into the nuclear field of the navy and had aspirations of being an instructor in a nuclear program. So with that hope in mind I I entered the room and answered a number of the questions that he asked me about. One thing that I found out very quickly as he was trying to get me to agree with him that I was trying to avoid the draft that_x0080__x0099_s why I was enlisted in the navy and I was trying to convince him that no that was not the reason I'm joining the navy and he eventuallysaid something that I could agree with half heartedly and I said something like I guess so and to which he said you guess so what do you mean you guess so to which I answered well I guess that's a habit I picked up from my mother and upon that answer he directed me in no uncertain terms yet get out of my office we don't need any of your gd habits so I was accompanies with another officer to a room solitary room by myselfand I was left there for probably thirty minutes it seemed like quite a long time and during that time it was just a good great time of meditating and reviewing you know my life and I don't really need this program to to make it in this life and after thirty minutes an officer came in said you've made it in the program congratulations welcome to the submarine service. Uh at that time I thought I was ah in line to be a an instructor in the nuclear power program and not a submarine the only submarine I had ever been on was Disneyland_x0080__x0099_s yellow submarine maybe you've heard of it ah and I asked them if I could have two weeks to consider that with my wife and they granted them so after two weeks of of thoughtful it is this good for us is it good for me we decide yes let's let's go with that program and so I enlisted and said yes to the nuclear powered submarine program. Ah at that time uh it was it was I was about six months away from actually enrolling into the boot camp the officers program in Rhode island ah um so gave me opportunity of dabbling in some other work and but eventually the day came and I went back to uh Rhode island for the uh the recruitment of officers the boot camp training which lasted about nineteen.

No I can just talk about one day of this kid. <She was...> She was eight months old when she came, and she came from the board and care facility where she'd been for like three months. So, she was weird, and we had already a bunch of kids, and I knew that babies were...in this one, never cried, all she did was smile when she looked at you, and she couldn't do anything. She couldn't roll over, she couldn't sit up, she couldn't do anything a normal eight month old would do. And the specific event was, I got so worried about the kid in the middle of the night, I had my husband get up, and we get up. Ruben, there's something really wrong with her. She never cries. Look at her. She should be crying or fussing, and she doesn't. In...what baby doesn't wake up in the night and bellyache and moan and groan, and this one just never did.

You know we just worry...I worry silly about this kid that never was fussy. And, that, but I can't talk five minutes about Yolanda smiling and but that's the story I thought of was Yolanda. Jess...

Nobody paid any attention to her except if she smiled, and they never...nobody never picked her up or did anything, so all she knew how to do was just...she could barely roll over, but she just smiled and laughed and then I think she got attention, so she was...and she was quite chubby. Hell, all they did was feed her formula or something, and, so anyway. It was a delight, because she learned a new trick every week. I mean, by thirteen months, she was walking and going all around and doing everything. I mean she just, and believe me, we adopted her eventually. She now. And she learned how to...how to behave normally, but anyway that's... From that night, no, only the...we would just go check on her like every hour or two. We would be up all night and so the kid it didn't all night and she never did. We get up all worry and she'd be rested. He was just as puzzled as I was.

So uhm, my husband and I got married when I was uh nineteen, not quite nineteen, and uhh it took a while before uhm we felt that we had sufficient income in order to have children. uhm we probably would have waited longer except that are friends, we had two couples that we were friendly with, the Levitz and the rubens, and they began to have children. later they each had a sandy levin had Robbie has her first child he was born in March and then uhm Judy Ruben had Michelle she was born like in June and uh as the each of them told us that they were pregnant we started thinking that if we didn't get pregnant then weÕd be having our children all by ourselves and if you know the friends to shared it with no no help. So, low and behold uhm I had no problem getting pregnant, I was twenty-five. Uhm, I don't recall any problems with the pregnancy I was teaching mathematics at uh Plymouth white marsh high school in Plymouth meeting Pennsylvania and I taught all of high school and I recall that um when I was five months pregnant, uhm one of the teachers came to me in the in the staff lounge and said, ÒFlossie are you pregnant?Ó I said, ÒyesÓ and she said, Òbecause my students are all talking about it and I just wanna be able to tell them yesÓ and I said, Òyou could tell them yes.Ó I was about four and a half months pregnant at that point uhm I didnÕt think I was I wasn't wearing maternity clothes, but I I specifically remember that incident. so um, percent all my students knew it like went like wildfire around the school and very soon after that, the administration of the school district sent me a letter saying that they expected me to resign that uhm at that time they couldn't possibly imagine the children would would uh want to see a pregnant teacher and they actually forced me to retire the rate resign because uhm I was five months pregnant, and they didn't want you to stay one day after that. So, may first, our daughter was born august first, nineteen sixty-nine. So, all of you what young women should realize that you are so lucky because there's none of these things now. the next year after I resigned, I heard that a woman refused to resign, and they couldn't force her to. So, i left uhm IÕm trying to think I think around uhm maybe may first and I remember all the parents signed a petition saying they wanted me to stay because I was doing such a great job and I didn't wanna leave and the students wanted me to stay parents wanted me to stay and it was only like six more weeks, but they they forced me to get out. So, i did and actually I remember when I was the able stay sleep late in the morning and get up late and not have to get dressed and as especially as I got closer to my pregnancy that um, I thought that this actually not that bad that I was home. so um, I remember that uhm I had like a lot said to the i think what happened was uhm I started to have pain in my back and i didn't know spend first pregnancy I don't I have no idea what it would feel like to have child. So, I had these like pains in my back like you strained your back and I said to my husband I don't know if this is labor you know so uh it's full term at this point, it's two weeks before my due date. uhm so I had this pain in my back like you know like lower back, like back here, and ah it was getting worse and worse and and I just said ÒI can't imagine like what can I do to get rid of thisÓ and said ÒI think I think IÕm just gonna lie down.Ó So, I think I laid down in bed and very soon after that hum my water broke at like that I think I made a towel down cause I heard from some people that could happen. So uhm, there we were uhm I said to my husband ÒI think we need to go to a hospital.Ó So, hospitals only like, I donÕt know, ten minutes away. So, i remember you know that time you have a little backpack packed a bag and I went to the hospital and um it seemed to take hours hours and hours and hours and hours I remember our second child was born like in in the car practically like the minute I got into the hospital, but the first ones they don't wanna come out. And so, ah I remember you know being in the the area where the women were in labor and my husband had taken, he's a dentist, uh he took a course in hypnosis and amazingly, he was actually he was actually able to hypnotize me in a way that I was actually able to sleep in between these periods of these contractions and I remember the contractions being really really really really painful and I remembered this but the nurse would take this scope and put it on my belly and and I screamed at her, Òstop punching meÓ i remember that felt like she was like banging my belly, but I mean this is my daughters now fifty she was born in sixty-nine, so she's fifty-one I remember every detail of this. so um, you know that the contractions got get closer and closer and uhm low and behold and and people in those days were being sedated with like patella not pitosin I forget the name of the drug, but they would be asleep and my cousin, Phyllis, had told me that if we had childbirth classes that I could be a totally awaken on medicated and we had taken these classes about breathing and pushing and all that and and uh I did not want to have any medication and, but it was really really painful I remember when they said you know like at the end of push and ah and I remember like when when I pushed in, and I think the doctor uhm was it my my doctor uhm I think had broken his hand or something playing tennis, oh its five minutes okay.

So, it they helped me find um a place to live and and um you know, did all of that kind of support, but they they didn't know anything beyond that. and so, i they took me down to my school and and helped me move into my um it wasn't really a dormitory it was a boarding house, and it was the week that uh before school started and i had three roommates and um i remember it one day in particular that my three roommates were very very busy with ah paper it was sort of like magazine paper ep open and they were very focused it with going through it, studying it, writing information from it, onto a a a piece, you know, piece of paper and they were just very very involved going back and forth between pages studying it, writing down details and i finally said to them Ã_x0092_what,Ã_x0093_ you know, Ã_x0092_what are you doing?Ã_x0093_ and they said, Ã_x0092_weÃ_x0095_re trying to figure out our class schedule.Ã_x0093_ and i realize that i had no idea how to i don't know what i thought was going to happen. i don't know how i thought i was gonna go to class i don't know how i thought i was going to take classes who i was going to take them from what classes i was going to take and neither did my parents. IÃ_x0095_d IÃ_x0095_d simply assumed that i would get up one day and go somewhere, where i don't know, but somebody would tell me which classes i was gonna take and where i would go to take them cuz that had been my history. i had no idea that i had to do that for myself. and so, i had to get that information from my uhm roommates and figure it out for myself and it was terrifying. uhm i didn't even have the the book that they were using to figure out what classes they were taking. So, i had to literally run to the bookstore, get this manual that they were using, and then sit down and try and figure out what i was going to do and i didn't even know what classes i was supposed to take, what classes i had to take, what classes were required, what classes werenÃ_x0095_t required, how many classes i was supposed to take, and literally i had to do that with no guidance from anybody other than asking my roommates Ã_x0092_well, what am i supposed to do.Ã_x0093_ and so, registration for my first semester at college was an absolite absolute nightmare and i um literally was terrified. Um and my first year away from home um, particularly my first semester away from home, was a well terrifying is really about the only word that i can use to describe it because i did not know what i was doing, i went from being when one of the, you know, Ã_x0092_aÃ_x0093_ students in my high school to almost flunking out my first semester because i literally did not d know what i was doing and was scared the entire time.

I was six months pregnant movie and I remember going to sleep and I woke up and I went into the bathroom, and I had to go the bathroom and ah uh my water broke. Well, I didn't I I kind of knew what had happened, but I was so naive but was like oh what's going on here and uhm I woke him up and uhm I called my mother my mother said, Òwhy are you calling me? call the doctor in the hospital and get to the hospital.Ó So, we did. we went to the hospital and all I worried about going to the hospital, wasn't in any pain or anything, was that we were planning to move in ah the next two days and ah move to a new apartment and we uhm you know IÕve kept thinking Òoh my gosh. this can't be happening. IÕm gonna get sent home.Ó anyway got to the hospital and the doctor met us at the emergency room and it was not my regular doctor, it was another doctor and he looked at me and he said, Òyou can't be pregnant and because you don't look pregnantÓ and I wasn't. I had only gained a very little weight at that time and uhm so anyway, we went in and about they gave me a shot of of ah to numb me and three hours later they had to give me another shot because that one wore off and I remember the doctor saying to me, you know, Òthe first one was on your insurance this oneÕs on you. you guys are gonna have to pay for this one.Ó and anyway, my daughter was born, and she was over three months almost three months early and she was very premature, obviously, and they immediately took her to an incubator or didn't tell me they put her in an incubator, they just took her away. and uhm couple hours later, my husband was able to wheel me down to the nursery and we got to the nursery I said, Òoh, which one is it? which one is she? and they kept wheeling me past that nursery to a second nursery where there were all these incubators and she I will never forget seeing her burst into tears because she looked like one of those rubber chickens that them speak chicken so, she was all stretched out and she had this giant head but no body was so tiny. Anyway, uhm I went home the next day and she couldn't go home for over a month. she was in the hospital, and we had to uhm I used to go every day and watch them feed her, I couldn't hold her or anything until three and a half weeks into that we were able to I was able to feed her and then take her home. Uhm but I always remember ca ah the thing about the move was when I was lying in the hospital and they said uhm, you know, Òyou're gonna go home tomorrowÓ and I was like, Òoh no, we haven't moved yet. we didn't own a diaper, we didn't own a crib, we were all planning to do all of that after we moved and got settled in.Ó and ah never realizing that she wasn't gonna go home with me. I was still kind of in shock with that. But uhm, you know, that was pretty pretty significant after a month of being able to bring bring her home and, you know, start living what we what we thought was normal, but normal life with a brand-new infant. Uhm and ultimately, she, you know, ah after about a year and a half, caught up size wise et cetera and everything. uhm the doctor was pleased she never we never figured out why there was no reason that she came so early uhm but ah certainly, a traumatic but ah an event that I can still remember you know the details. Oh, the other thing was about an hour after she was born, they said to me, Òis there anything you want?Ó I said, Òyes IÕm starving could you pleaseÓ and they brought me bacon and eggs and toast in the hospital, which they said was really weird for a new mom that wouldn't wouldn't they wouldn't normally do that right away.

So, i get into the Jakarta airport and i had passed through a couple of international i i i i think it was we had another stop or something but i been at least to two the international airports in Asia before i arrived at Jakarta and what struck me is i get into this line to be inspected and at the end behind each one of the inspectors was an armed soldier uh with a submachine gun and i i i I didn't know what to think other than yÃ_x0095_know Ã_x0092_what's going on, did something happen today or or whateverÃ_x0093_ and IÃ_x0095_m yÃ_x0095_know you take a while to you wind your way up and of course the soldiers were absolutely doing nothing they were just standing there they have their guns were called up or anything else but it was just the the image as i arrived this was in nineteen sixty-three but uh the uh the net of it was that i got up there and ah i the person who is inspector had a capacity in English and they i was just a visitor asked is the standard questions i said i was there for a short period of time and i ask I said that I ah ah ah was curious about the soldiers ugh Ã_x0092_it's did something happenÃ_x0093_ and he said, Ã_x0092_no they're here they're just here for your safetyÃ_x0093_ gave me some kind of excuse like that but there was no evidence that i was just struck by their their presence. Now, later on i became a student of kind of southeast Asia so i could feel something in but at the time i was just struck by it i walked out and it it it had made me feel a bit uncomfortable. i ask about dat you know how where to get some help i had to change some money and right away they referred me or, as i recall it, the the inspector said uh Ã_x0092_These are the people that will help you they'll take you to your hotel.Ã_x0093_ Well, my hotel happened to be in the wetware the end there was an Asian games complex its president sukarno had built as a show piece and it was standing empty uhm and quite far from downtown Jakarta and fairly far from the airport i had no sense of of location but IÃ_x0095_m telling you it was pretty far. Anyway, this uh this young man wasn't assigned to me but it was like i stepped out he was at the head of the queue of people who were ready as taxi drivers to take arriving international visitors to wherever they needed to go and he spoke of a small amount of English. i needed to get some local currency so, i went and got the local currency, he's on my shoulder area is right beside me i can't remember whether i i think i had one bag and so i may well have let him carry it i i can't remember but i went and i changed some currency so ah i don't at know what point i thought about here i am showing this person how much money IÃ_x0095_m gonna put in my wallet but in actual fact i don't think it bothered me at the time. then then i showed him uh i don't think i have shown it before then where i was going to go and it was written down in in English not in uhm Indonesian but it said ah simple something simple like hotel Asian games complex and that was all didn't have a name didn't have a telephone number and uh he said all i know as if he did well he knew where the Asian games were but we drove for ever and i thought you know in the course of that here i am i am a happy go lucky young man and i have money in my pocket and everything else but i just arrived with this money in my pocket and this guy is driving me in the dead of the night in the darkness of the night and to a place that i don't know i don't even have a telephone number for it and the like and the ah the ah ah the reason i knew about this is i knew that there was a group of of peace corps volunteers who were still in training they just passed through manila i had the uh had something to do uh uh with speaking to them while they were uh uh in a layover at the manila international airport. and so, i knew they were at this hotel right in this complex and we were and that's how i knew about this place and of course i was looking for cheap lodging i didn't want to spend all my money. So, a wig we got out to this area again it's not lit at night uh there are some scattered lights and then you have the stadiums there couple of them in buildings and so forth and we wander around because this guy has never been there to deliver anybody and we go around and he eventually finds ah runs into somebody like a guard and asked him course i can understand what he's asking him, but uh yÃ_x0095_know, Ã_x0092_where is this placeÃ_x0093_ and what we're really talking about is like a dormitory there's no flashing light there's no pull up for four with ah ah ah ah a big front of the hotel kind of thing. and so we, we went around back behind where we had been and iced i felt like he was doing a good job on my part on my behalf, but basically it was going longer and longer and i sure hoped that i was gonna get to my destination which i pretty much did uh about five minutes after we had cleared this first guy and he went around and and found found a location where the lights were on, a building lit up because they don't have a lot of people staying there and i got out paid, him, thanked him and i had arrived at uh uh Jakarta.

Umm when i was twenty one umm i  i worked for a school district and i had to find a summer job every summer umm because i didn't get paid for some months and uh when i was twenty one i took a job as umm in arts and crafts director at uh summer camp. i'd never gone camping before So it was important to me and exciting.  Umm soo what a day like that feels like umm it changed and um im just going to keep a little background.  Umm so ah i had i had worked at an elementary school since i was sixteen years old. so i had done some arts and crafts projects and observed others. i didn't have any special education and that area but um it was something that i could handle.  Umm  one of the one of the counselors who worked with me um was very interested in horses owned her own horse brought her horse to camp.  Um she was an art major um and she had an accident with the horse. the horse actually fell on her.  since she was going to have to go home  um except i i offered to change positions with her and i would become a counselor because she was unable to walk any longer and she would be the arts and crafts counselor.  Umm the craft room was in a little umm it was called the crafts shack and it was a little shack actually with a with a bed inside and uh and then there was a big porch with um with a wooden picnic table and that's where the kids would gather to do the craft  um whatever crafts were going on during the day so i would go over in the morning and i would um i would help her set all the supplies out that she would need me the day of crafts and i would take uh i would take her kids on whatever activities they were doing for the day. umm  i don't remember really specifically on what those other activities were but there was swimming for sure because i learned how to swim better while i was there and became friends and visited um the lifeguard after camping sessions were over.  Um my friend was really happy that she got to stay on uh i do remember i do remember having um some difficulty with discipline in the um in the group and there were little girls who were gossiping and and not getting along very well and i remember taking this big plastic jar of gasoline and i banged it on table and it kind of shattered but it got their attention and i just talked about how necessary it was for us all to get along and i think after that um they really did put some effort into it they they realized that you know they weren't going to have the best camping experience if they were just bickering and um  not being very nice to each other. Um i do remember uh we slept outside so the arts and crafts director had the cushy little shack probably with mice running in and out. but but the other campers the um and the counselors slept outside um in bunk beds the were just kinda out in the wilderness underneath trees and such. um i remember it was very hot and um and uh nearly twenty years later i moved across the valley from where that camp um that campground was and my sister lives very close to it today. it's completely different. um very dry. Um   it's uh it's in the santa clarita valley. Um i remember it was the first time I ever saw a manzanita wood which is ah it's very red on the inside and um and i one of the things i did during the summer while i was there i chipped piece of manzanita wood that i found and i started polishing it to um polished it all summer. i wish i still had that piece of wood i i don't know what happened to it you know i probably wasn't as significant at the time but i it was significant enough that i worked on it the whole summer long and it was lovely.  Um we had a big we had a big ah central heating area where we would go and get our food and uh it was it it seems to me that it was ah like an inside cafeteria where you would go and get the food but then come out and eat it. ah at the tables again there were tables. every group had there own table.

3716_NormalText_INTERVIEW_ONLY_1-14-21.edited.txt,Ok my wedding day took place August fourteenth nineteen seventy one. Long time ago. Um it august is very warm in Southern California um at the time my father was the commanding officer at North Island Naval Air Station so we have the ceremony at the chapel there on the base.  And of course the groomsmen and the bridesmaids and etc. arrive a little bit early and they go into separate dressing rooms to get ready for the big event and their pictures being taken and so forth. Well I had um  two of my sisters my only two sisters and three um three friends in my wedding so we were not a huge wedding party but sizeable and we are trying to do everything we could not to perspire in our dresses. If cause there was no air conditioning there were only fans blowing so here we are trying to stay cool calm and collected and we hear from the opposite side of the church this raucous laughter didn't know what was going on but we could tell it was all the guys. Now on my husband's side of the wedding party he had his six groomsmen but he also had six the navy so there were thirteen guys over there plus the priest and whoever else and what had happened which I didn't find out until much later is that the um the monsignor had come in and he had all of his vestments on and he was trying to control these dozen or young men to get serious about a wedding and he accidently backed into one of the fans and it just ate up his vestments so that's why these guys were going so hysterical. So um obviously I didn_x0080__x0099_t find out about that until much later but um the wedding ceremony was uh a catholic ceremony. I'm not catholic but my husband and his family are um and his mother flew out from Boston which was a big deal for her because she had never been on an airplane. Her His father refused to get on an airplane so she came on her own and she was so impressed that a monsignor was gonna preside over this wedding so I know that that meant a lot to her. It was um rather long because it was a catholic mass and it was still horribly hot so we were all kind of wilting a little bit but everything was said and done we uh we left the church well actually you go kind of into a little alcove as you're leaving because you need to sign the marriage certificate and then that gives an all the people enough time to get outside and the swordsmens to draw their swords and pretty and so um we departed from that and jumped in to a U.S. Navy car as opposed to a limousine cause we were on the base and my parents um lived on the base in quarters there but they had a beautiful backyard with a giant magnolia tree which I was told was the third largest magnolia tree in California but I have no proof of that. Ah and that's where our reception was held in the backyard underneath the magnolia tree it was the wedding was at two so the reception was about three thirty till maybe five thirty nothing like receptions that are happening today with the giant dinners and all that sort of thing and from there um I changed it to my departure outfit which would be hysterical today because at that time we were wearing like gogo boots and skirts and I had this little jaunt to catch. It was pretty funny well and I thought it looked pretty hot but to at look the pictures now it's kind of silly and then we went uh downtown and we found some dinner and we spent our honeymoon night at the Westgate plaza downtown and the next morning we got in an airplane and went to Boston to see his dad and his mother caught up with us a couple days later because she was still having fun in southern California.

Um_x0080_¦ like, we had to go find a local golf course in--and_x0080_¦ bring back, you know, take a pin out of the hole, or something, and bring it back, or something like that.

3721_NormalText_INTERVIEW_ONLY_02-08-21.edited.txt," I graduated from the university of Wisconsin School of Nursing with a B.S. in nursing in nineteen sixty and I was gonna come back my parents lived in Milwaukee um the university was in Madison, so I hadn't lived at home for four years. So, I was gonna come back home and live at home for a short time, so I saved enough money and work a children's hospital in Milwaukee. I'm the oldest daughter and my I have a younger sister five years younger and my mother and I were always a sort of fractious is a way to say it but my sister said that she never had to fight with my mother because I_x0080__x0099_d I_x0080__x0099_d broke all the boundaries for her, and it was easy but my mother told me that I could not come home and live at home. Said the house wasn't big enough for the two of us it has grown ups which sort of devastated me cause I had sorted my plans made out. But it was the biggest thing that best thing that ever happened to me in life. Um I went to Chicago where I didn't know a single soul and I worked at children's memorial hospital and they put me a young graduate on E floor this was before there were ICU_x0080__x0099_s and um Doctor Potts who was from the East Coast was there and he was doing um open heart surgery on children and young very young children and it was all new there were very few there only two places in the country where that were doing it. So, they put me on this floor, and you couldn't make a mistake and you had you took care of kids who came out of surgery for the either the first twenty-four hours in the recovery room or on the on the E floor after that and it was challenging, I mean you just had to grow. So pretty soon I decided that I had to work nights because during the day no one had any time to talk to you. Does that make sense? That the doctors were all busy doing their surgery the nurses were don't bother me and you'd so it wasn't learning very much so I went and worked nights and people had a little bit more time especially if the residents were coming around checking the kids at, they could tell me what the surgery was what they had done and what wasn't. So, I really learned a tremendous amount, but you couldn't make a mistake you had to be on your toes every minute of the time you never had more than three kids in the recovery room, but you had over twenty at a through through the night and there wasn't anybody else. It was just you. So if you had any concerns the things weren't going right with that kid you had to get the doctor and believe me he did not if he had been up all day doing surgery was doing surgery tomorrow he did not want to be awoken for anything that wasn't if all of them and it don't bother me or you would be they would make sure that you got out of there you wouldn_x0080__x0099_t last than that but it was wonderful. I mean you just you grew and grew and grew and grew and you you you learn to do things that's ah and take responsibility for two things to trust your judgment. I mean it was just it was it was wonderful it was the best thing that ever happened that ever happened to me my mother sending me to Chicago.  Yeah that was nineteen graduated in nineteen sixty and it was I worked there for a year and a half till I got married.  I remember I remember a funny one. One day I they asked me if I would work on instead of working at night if I would work on a Saturday because it was the summertime and there was a it was vacation time and I said I would. I said but that meant I took the recovery room and on Saturdays they did circumcision for little kids um and there was a little six year old African American boy and he had a restraint on his leg but he didn't have any arm restraints on and he sort of woke up from the anesthesia and he looked at me and he stood up and said damn white woman cut off my dick and hit me right across the head . Fortunately on the way down my arm hit the emergency button and he said that woman cut off my dick.  i'll never forget that. People couldn_x0080__x0099_t stop laughing.  Yeah, and the kid wouldn't cut stop shouting that I cut off his dick.   No no I just had to sit down for a few minutes go by the time they got him settle down and stuff but he didn't want me anywhere near him. They had to put another person because I was to blame.

3731_NormalText.INTERVIEW_ONLY_edited.txt," So I'm going to describe to you, or tell you the tale of my, how I, I grew up in New Jersey about  ten miles across the river from Philadelphia. And uh, went to Catholic schools in grammar school and high school, uh went to, went to a four year college in uh, in New England. And upon graduation my best friend John, who I met my freshman year of college, um we were just by luck we were roommates, assigned as roommates. And you know, the same dorm room. And uh quickly became friends, John was from White Plains New York and um from that time until we became best friends really fast, and lifelong friends. He passed away unfortunately about three years ago. Uh, a brain tumor, but uh we had a riparung times back in the day. And uh with all the all the usual college shenanigans that uh, that you might imagine. But upon our graduation which is, I won_x0080__x0099_t tell you about my whole college experience, but uh that was really wonderful. To play college football and got good grades and a lot of people and it just opened the world for me. I grew up in a working class family in New Jersey, my dad was a truck driver who dropped out of high school. Um, but uh they loved me dearly and supported me in everything I did and helped me get through school. So anyhow, upon graduation we hung out for just a couple of days on campus with some friends and, ya know, just partied and having a good time. And um John and I were figuring out what we were gonna do next and I said well, you know I've never been to California. And everyone talks about let's go to California, we uh we were out drinking. We were at a bar, when we decided this. Is, and the bars didn't close until five in the morning in Rhode Island. Umm so we got quite drunk that's when I came up with the idea. I think of, I don't know, it was maybe three in the morning.  He said uh, gee that sounds great. He said, so let's go. So I just, I don't even like to tell this part of the story. I mean we were really drunk, we should not have gotten in a car, but we did. We  drove, I don't know, maybe an hour and we thought it would be better to just pull over. So I turned the car, uh drove to his parents house in White Plains and down to my parents house in South Jersey. Told them our plans. My mother was aghast, his parents were very supportive, thought it was a great idea. A uh real adventure. My mother was like, ``What do you mean your gonna go to California? What are you gonna do when you get there? If you make it there._x0080__x009d_ I was like, we_x0080__x0099_ll get jobs Ma. _x0080__x009c_What kind of job, what are you gonna do? Do you have any plans?_x0080__x009d_ I said, we'll be fine, mom. We_x0080__x0099_ll be fine, don't worry.   So and sure enough you know we drove and took our time. It took us almost three months to go across. We stopped at a lot, we  we did a lot of camping and backpacking together when we were in college. So you know, we stopped at a lot of campgrounds across the country because we had friends, because we had friends from college. Like in Detroit and Chicago and Salt Lake City and so on so forth. So we visited some of them, and then um we had a third party. His, his friend from high school, who I knew because he would come up and visit us frequently in college. So it was the three of us. And um, he wanted to go to L. A.  His friend. I had actually been to San Diego once prior to that, I uh visited my aunt and uncle in Anaheim California. And San Diego was about ninety minutes south, and he took us  over the state, it was amazing. But anyhow, I always, he took us to San Diego for a day. And I just remember, It_x0080__x0099_s just like, I just said I_x0080__x0099_m gonna live here someday. So that's why we decided to target San Diego, everybody trusted my judgment. And uh, so we got here. Uh, I had ran out of money by that time, John had some money. His, he was, wasn_x0080__x0099_t from a wealthy family but a pretty well to do family in New York. So he had a nice bank account, uh so you know he just loaned me a few thousand dollars. And I told him I would pay him back some day. And um, so we enrolled in bartending school, it was a one week course. We went to an Ivy League school, so I told my parents I was at bartending school. And they were like, _x0080__x009c_What are, what are you gonna do with your life? You went over there just to stout it._x0080__x009d_  So anyhow, I got a job at the red cells inn on shelter island, it's a really, a seafood restaurant right on the water. We had a dock behind the boat we rented out, so so big sail boats could stay there, uh in the summers. Tuna fishermen would come in and the other was start his tuna canary right next to the restaurant. And uh so the fisherman, these guys were hard core dudes that were, you know, they where out at sea for six eight weeks at a time and they_x0080__x0099_d bring in tons of fish in their in their boats. Um, and they_x0080__x0099_d come into the bar and get very drunk. Leave big tips for the bartender so it was really it was really a fun experience. But I know I know I didn't want to be, eventually, the management of the restaurant um approached me one day, the owners I mean. They bought it, they just bought it from the previous owner. So I stayed there for about nine months. He had been coming in for months and they never really introduced themselves or anything. And then one day they said, we_x0080__x0099_re gonna buy this restaurant. And yeah we've been watching you tend the bar you look like you like to sound like you'd like to be more than a bartender. Do you what to learn how to run a restaurant? We_x0080__x0099_ll teach you how to be a manager, you know a restaurant manager. I loved the business, I said sure that sounds great.

So, at the end of the backstroke I was in first place. So, then at the end of the backstroke, I did an open turn, turned on to my stomach and pushed off underwater, did a full pull down to my sides, and then breaststroke_x0080_¦ arms and kick to the surface. Back then, your head had to stay up above the surface for the rest of the length, and breaststroke was my best stroke. So by the end of the breaststroke length, I was ahead by a body length and a half. So, I touched with two hands, I turned around and pushed off hard, and started swimming freestyle as fast as I could, swam all the way to the end, I could see the girl next to me catching right up with me, and we raced to the end, and she touched me out. So, even though we only had one length of freestyle to do, I lost it in one length freestyle. The only thing I have to say about it is the other girl was the national record holder for a twenty-five-yard free style. So, uh, my coach was very disappointed, my parents and teammates couldn't believe I lost it in one length of freestyle, but I always felt like that was my very best event I ever swam, and it was that one hundred_x0080_¦ individual medley was faster than any one hundred freestyle I ever swam. <The end.> INTERVEIWER",Normal,21,0,68.0,1.0,14.0,483.0,185.0,23.0,33.0,16.0,12.0,43.0,1.0,0.383022774,0.995316159,3734,7174.0,694.0,24.3,151.0,0.0967382213548927,0.217579250720461,0.035014409221902
3735_NormalText_INTERVIEW_ONLY_8-28-20.transcript.edited.transcript.txt," I grew up on a farm in the middle of nowhere in Canada and so when I was thirteen/fourteen years old and I was going to- i had just graduated from eighth grade in an elementary school, which was a one room schoolhouse. and so, when i was time to go to high school, there was no high school nearby and so, i had to figure out a way to get to high school and I had a lot of brothers and sisters and none of them had ever gone to high school for that reason, but I was determined, and I kept asking my mother that I wanted to go to high school. and so, she talked to somebody at the church and uhm they found a lady that was living in the town where the high school was that would wanted somebody to help with babysitting and housework. and so, to start ninth grade, I went to live with this lady, and I took care of her two children and helped around the house and helped prepare meals and so forth. when I graduated from eleventh grade in this small town and there was only twenty-eight students in my class, i had to figure out a way to get to college. I wasn't uhm satisfied with just graduating high school. So, i talked to my principal- and he was like the principal and the counselor and because I was one of the top students in the class, he said he would think about it and then help me and shortly afterwards he came to me and said, Ã_x0092_well I can't think of many a uh college scholarships or anythingÃ_x0093_ and the closest college was eighty miles away and because I lived on a farm there was no way I could get there but he helped me get a job with a large company in that town so so it was surf city. and so, i was really excited about that and he wrote a letter reference. So, i had gotten an appointment or an interview with this large company and I had to talk my father into taking a day off from farming to drive me they're in the old truck and I was so embarrassed I didn't know what I was gonna do, but he drove me there and he sat in the lobby of this big uh office building and I went into the human resources department and was interviewed for this job, and it was nothing very uh dramatic, it was just working as a clerk in the mailroom sorting mail when I was happy to just get a job and I did that for that first year here in the company, but I knew that I wanted to do more. So, i decided to go to night school and I took scenography classes and I learned shorthand and I spent time improving my typing skills until I passed and was able to get you know, fifty words a minute and qualify for a secretary's job. and so, at the end of my year there, uhm my boss said that he was so pleased with my work, and I was fast and efficient that he got- I told I told him about my typing skills at my stenography- and so he got me a job as a clerk typist in the health insurance department. and so, I was there, and I again was fast and efficient and in no time flat I was always sitting around with nothing to do because whatever work they gave me I got it done really fast. and so, this boss noticed it and he suggested I go help another department and I was told whenever I had free time on my hand to go into the data processing department and I helped uhm transcribe data onto computer cards-they had the first big computers where you did data entry. then I worked in there off and on whenever I had time and then pretty soon, it was anoth it was my second year was up, and then I got promoted to being a secretary for the boss- he hired me personally. So, I was working for him and I had found out while working in mailroom that this insurance company had offices in all of the major cities in the United States and I had an older sister who's married and living in Minneapolis, Minnesota. So, I got the idea uh to maybe go there. and so, I wrote a letter to her and asked her how much they paid for secretary in Minneapolis, and I found out that I could get like two hundred dollars more a month and she said I could live with her. So, i decided to do that. and so, I she uh helped sponsor me and she went to her embassy, and I went to our embassy, and we got all the paperwork necessary and within three months, i got permission and got uhm my papers so that I could be a permanent resident of the United States and I took the train from Winnipeg, Manitoba to Minneapolis, Minnesota and went to live with my sister and just so happened she only lived thirteen blocks from the university of Minnesota, which she had failed to tell me. So, I got the idea that I would apply to the university. So, i went down the university and uh went and walked around and I found out where I had to go, and I went in and asked if I could apply. So, i filled out all the paperwork and then I was told I had to take some entrance exams. Now, since English was my second language, I always had had difficulty with English in high school. and so, when I took the entrance exams, I passed everything with flying colors, especially math and science, but I failed my English exam. So, i had to take what they call Ã_x0092_bonehead EnglishÃ_x0093_ at night school. and so, I started and I took some classes at the university, and I took this English class and because I had such a terrific professor, i was able to master English finally and he I ended up with getting an a in the class, believe it or not, and he said that because it was a noncredit, class he couldn't give me an a, that the highest class they could give in that class that can promote students was a c, but if I was happy with the c, he would give me credit which is awesome. So, i was so happy and then I uhm started my upper classes. when I finished my first semester, I got a letter from the dean, and I was on the dean's list he said, Ã_x0092_we've never had a student who was admitted on probation,Ã_x0093_ because of my poor English, Ã_x0092_end up on the dean's list.Ã_x0093_ So, i was really happy because of that and then I continued. I was living with my sister and going to school, and she helped me get a weekend job.

And this was in the height of the Vietnam war so, things were a lot different than then they are now in that there was yÃ_x0095_know today thereÃ_x0095_s no draft and then there was. So, I uh I signed up to go into marine corps because i wanted to go to uh officer candidate school and the marine corps was the only one taking uh people everybody else was booked up obvious reasons. So, I uh graduated from college and then I went to uh Quantico Virginia in um end of September of nineteen sixty-nine. and basically, the way it works is you fly into Washington dc and uh they meet you uh in the in the um airport terminal and uh you stuck out being an officer youÃ_x0095_re not quite as treated as poorly as you were if you were just a plc. or private but you stand out and then they load you on a um bus and then till you get on the nus, you were a civilian but the minute you step into the bus all hell breaks loose. And so now you're a marine and proud of it. So, uh uh drill instructor gets on and again things are pretty calm they're just confirming what's going on and yÃ_x0095_know itÃ_x0095_s about a itÃ_x0095_s about a forty-five-minute drive down to Quantico. and I mur remember it was a Sunday, which I thought was a little unusual but anyway we get off and uh we get ah off uh uh bus and the door opens and then when then its ye ye youÃ_x0095_re in the marine corps checkpoint and your yÃ_x0095_know the classic standing in the feet of uh   another dog brought on the asphalt uh three feet apart him yelling and screaming and a lot of people a brought stuff and they throw that all into a pile and you can get that later and they start yelling and they start yelling and they donÃ_x0095_t stop yelling for hours and it's it's quite the whole idea of it is to get you away from what you're used to, your comfort levels uh they want to break they say break you down and build you up but thatÃ_x0095_s thatÃ_x0095_s kind of overstated but for the most part, everything you're used to people treating you nice uh being friendly uh not insulting you that all goes out the window and it goes out the window quite quickly. And it is kind of when you look at it now itÃ_x0095_s it's kind of humorous and the and the lines that the drill instructors used were uh if you see a movie later on about the marines yÃ_x0095_know you couldn't remember some of the lines because they they they got all the same lines I, think one guy wrote them all and then they all use them but it's just quite a uh eye opening experience I I remember uhm one of my I I actually teamed up with a friend of mine uh and he was on the same bus as I was and he's sitting in the barracks uh the first day and as he stands up uh he hits his head on a uhm uh what you call it a fire extinguisher that was hanging on the on the wall there and uh the drill instructor screams at the guy further Ã_x0092_I didn't tell you to bleedÃ_x0093_ and that that kind of that that that that he hea almost knocked himself out standing up quickly and he hits his head on the um on the umm uh fire extinguisher and he kind of tips over and he does bleed and so they hauled him out and again, this is all part of breaking uh yÃ_x0095_know the comfort level and gift getting you off on a on a different tone. can I ask how much time is left over to do just tell me?

Uh it will go through um some various significant events in my life uh um getting my first real job with United States air force. Um uh traveling uh to get married. Um a death that occurred uh very shortly after my marriage. And uh some of the challenges that all this presented.  Um to begin um I uh  received orders to Dover air force base in Delaware as my first assignment. This was prior to my being married. Um I had proposed to my wife um and uh our marriage was set for the twenty-first of June nineteen sixty-nine. So, I traveled to uh Dover from a training assignment that I had in uh Illinois and um signed in and uh met um my new bosses and met my first real air force base and uh talked about my job.  And I left after that with a space available flight from Dover, Delaware to  air force base, and um during this time it was challenging because um I did not know any scheduled departure or anything  my wife. I had made all these plans for our marriage that was gonna be about four days away, and uh eventually, I ended up in uh uh California uh and um turned up with my wife, and she had planned all the, the marriage activities, uh the rehearsal dinner, reservations for my uh uh family that was gonna visit and uh my mom and dad both came down and attended the wedding and uh my sister_x0080__x0099_s two daughters came down, my brother and quite a few of my friends came down from Washington.  So, it was a big event um it was uh attended by uh very close friends and the rehearsal dinner was uh was uh nice and attended by everyone, had a bachelor_x0080__x0099_s uh dinner and the outing and then had our wedding  small chapel in Burbank, California, white chapel. And then we had um our uh reception at my wife_x0080__x0099_s house and they had that all set up and it was very nice.  One interesting activity that occurred was a uh friend of my wife's spiked the punch and um some of the younger uh children including my um uh niece was not aware of that and, although she may have been aware of it, cause then she ended up getting drunk and I think she was only like uh uh thirteen or fourteen years old so that was a interesting story for the family to go back and uh uh look at uh um and that occurred at my wedding.  Um after the wedding um uh we loaded up all our  goods in a uhaul van and drove from Burbank to uh Dover air force base in Delaware and started our new life. At the same time, after my uh mother and father attended our wedding, they took the two girls uh my sisters my two nieces to uh our reunion in Colorado for my brother law and his family and that's where my sister and brother-in-law had to go to, I guess they had to go to they always apologize my sister always apologize she_x0080__x0099_s still she_x0080__x0099_s still living, she_x0080__x0099_s uh twelve years older than I am, and um uh she_x0080__x0099_s going through some dementia challenges and some memory challenges now but uh when she was fully uh capable, she would always apologize oh I always felt so bad that I didn't attend your wedding but that's uh that's the choices that were made anyway, my um uh father and mother drove there it was quite a long drive from California to Colorado for them at that time and they had a nice time and we had a nice time driving to uh Delaware and, and selling in there. The event that uh was most significant I think of all besides getting married um was when my father came home, they did a couple things and uh I don_x0080__x0099_t know the exact date he returned I think three or four days before uh the um uh time to go back to work but he went back to work that Monday at a uh paper mill and in Aberdeen, Washington, and he passed away.

3765_NormalText_INTERVIEW_ONLY_8-3-20.edited.transcript.txt," My first real job was in a small hospital run by the sisters of Mercy of Saint Vincent Depaul in south western Missouri. I was fifteen years old and going to be sixteen in about three months in August. I made application along with a number of other people, younger people sometimes...some older people because they were looking for additional nurses aides, young women they could...young people they could train to be an assistant to nurses. I was assigned to work in the OBGYN ward with three other women who are...or two other...two or three other women who were assistants to the nurse. There were a couple of nuns who were the the nurses who were the managers of the OBGYN ward which included a nursery for the newborn babies. I was trained by sister Madeline, and she called herself sister Madeline of the eagle eye because she could see everything and she wanted everything done exactly the way she showed me how to do that. She also created a manual that I could go back and look at. So my duties were many. We only had eight beds. We were a hospital for...the town was six...about six thousand people, but we were the...we were kind of the area hospital for a lot of other smaller towns. So my job entails doing the temperature pulse and respiration when I was on a particular shift. I was also charged with, depending on what shift I was on, taking care of the babies, feeding them, taking them out to the mother's, bringing them back, changing their diapers, rocking them if they were crying a lot and needed to go to sleep. I was also in charge of laying out the delivery rooms for Lala instruments. I assisted in the labor room. I assisted in the delivery rooms. I did not assist in any sort of ob operations, so was out of my...my view. So it was a very demanding job and I had to change the linens and take them to the laundry and...and so on and so forth. Everything that needed to be done by an assistant to the single nurse on duty in the single assistant was one of my duties. I also went from shift to shift, from the day shift to the swing shift to the midnight seven. The most...the most drum...dramatic thing that happened was I had been on a midnight shift and a lady came in at some point. I was also responsible for picking them up in a wheelchair and bringing them to the labor room and preparing them for their delivery. I was doing temperature pulse and respiration while sister on duty sister Pauline I think went upstairs to have breakfast. They were on for twelve hours at a time and prayers and so on, and she wouldn't go up until everything was kind of under control. I came out of taking temperature pulse and respiration and I heard the lady in the labour room calling out and buzzing me, and I went back there and she was obviously in great pain from the labor, and she said the baby's coming and I looked in the covers. By this time I had helped in a number of deliveries then had worked for a month and a half or so, two months. And I looked under the covers and I could see the baby crowning and the nurse wasn't there and neither was the doctor yet, because she'd just come in. So I ran to the phone at the nurses' station. I call the operator and I said tell Pauline...sister Pauline to get down here right away the baby's coming. There was only one woman. So I went back and was with the lady and watching her and watching the progress of this child being born. The head was born, and it looked very unusual. It didn't look like just the head of a baby. It looked like there was something wrong, so I was afraid that it was gonna choke the...also the cord was around its neck. So I was able to get the cord from off around its neck and I put my finger in its mouth and pulled out in case there was phlegm in the mouth, which there was sometimes, not usually whole lot, and in the process of doing that, I pulled away the sac that held the embryonic flood, in other words the baby was born with the deflated sack on its overcurrent face. All right. And then another pain came and the baby was delivered. So I kind of pulled the mother's blanket around the baby. I left it where it was. The placenta had not been delivered yet. And I left it where it was attached to its mother and the phone rang at the nurse's desk, and I...I said you know I'm going to be right back, so I ran to the nurse's station, I took the call, and sister Pauline was on the phone. I said ""sister the baby's already been born now"", so she comes running down, and she said why didn't you wrapped in a blanket. She said go in and bring the delivery table that's already set up just...we load in here, and so she could...she could take the instruments and deliver the placenta and we could the wrap the baby up and...and she did all of that and I wrapped the baby and I cleaned off it's feet...foot, everything I did in the deliver room. I would accept the baby from the doctor, get its fingerprints on, its footprints on a card. And then I...eventually I would take it to the nursery. So that was very dramatic for me, and I...I have the good training of sister Madeline, the other sister's involved, sister Pauline, sister Philomena. I had the...their training. And I also have had my mother talking about some of the issues that can happen when a baby was born, and one of them was the cord around the neck and how that, if that wasn't taken off or cut off, it could be...as a baby is born, it could...it could choke them.

3766_NormalText_INTERVIEW_ONLY_8-3-20.edited.transcript.txt," Our wedding was held in Columbia, Missouri on the fourteenth of June, 1969. It was in the first Christian church of Columbia. The pastor who conducted the wedding was my wife's girlhood pastor from Missouri. His name was Emilyon Pig, believe it or not. And his, Emily Pig was much better than, so he was. It was...it was a beautiful service addressed the was actually on the...the cover of one of the most popular bridal magazines of the time. We had...for bridesmaids, so i heard. Before groomsman, we all in in uniform. It was a military wedding. We broke rules by wearing our swords inside the church that I didn't know that was a rule of the time, but since it's a weapon, even though it's more of a decorative item to the uniform, it was considered to be a weapon and no weapons are allowed in church. But that...that was. We wore our swords in church. The...the best man actually was John. He introduced me to Karen as a result of Karen knowing John's wife and so the...the sequence of events was Pig told Karen as she was leaving to go to the university that she should look up Marilyn and because Marilyn was the daughter of a professor of agriculture who was a good friend of and so Karen met Marilyn. And Marilyn actually met John. John was in the navy program. I was in the navy program. John said that he had marijuana decided that Karen and I would probably be pretty good together and so he introduced us. We had a...our first date was to go to a movie. We went to dinner and then we watch a movie. It was the Jungle Book. So this was in the early 1968. The next day was a big day and we went to the military ball, which was the largest social event in terms of number of people attending of the larger social event at at our university of the time. We...we didn't see one another much the rest of the school year but we kept in contact, and I had first class midshipman cruise over the summer. Karen had...had gotten a job with Pan American world airways. For the time, they were recruiting a bi...a multi lingual stewardesses, and it was easy to get European women, and...and they were all women and the only is we do not call them flight attendants, they were stewardesses, and they're easily get to a multi lingual European women but they wanted an American one. Karen's second language was French. She applied for the job. She got it. She flew for Pan Am over the summer and then her job when she came back to school was to recruit multi lingual women at the school, at...at university to become a stewardess in need of...for example, one that she recruited was her roommate. Point of me mentioning that is that because she was flying to Pan Am over the summer and because I was on a and made a stop in pearl harbor Hawaii and she was flying into Honolulu, we were able to get together in Hawaii, and so I had her to dinner the war drew of...of that ship and then we start dating more. We got back to school, started dating really seriously. And then I didn't plan it, but I asked her to marry me and she blessed me by saying yes, so...so we were married by I described in the...in the church in Columbia, Missouri. I'm not sure how many guests. There were probably seventy, eighty, something like that...that says the grooms, there...there were...there were four bridesmaids, four groomsmen. The best man was John who introduced us. Unfortunately John is totally another story, he...he was a bomb but he served an important function in this case, we were commission yet. Another groomsman was Ted. Ted is a...is a remarkable guy, one of the hardest working guys I know. We graduated together, we're commission together. He went off to flight school when I came to my first ship. I...I rode the trolley between the two ships on the line and the chairs I went to my first ship on the gun line of Vietnam in September, 1969. Ted was in flight school. Ted has remained a friend over the years. I was a groomsman for him two weeks prior to our wedding, so last year the two couples together and we celebrated our wedding anniversary together by taking a trip to England and for the...we spent about two and a half weeks tour in England. For the last week, we were joined by another couple and then the three couples came home on the translated crossing on two, so...so that's the Teddy fall broken. They're...they're wonderful people in lifetime friends. And other groomsmen was John. Carter John also was commission with, and he went on had a very successful navy career. He commanded in LSD, later her commanded in LPD, probably would have been a flag officer but there was one...one issue and kept the captain for becoming a. The force was all wet. He...he was commissioned a one he went on submarine service track a bell. Because my roommate get not been commissioned at the time he was still a midshipman was a commission for several more months, he was an usher. So we had...we had an ensign groom and we had four ensign grossman. Before, the matron of honor was Marilyn one who introduced Karen and I meeted. The wife of John who introduced the two of us. There was Cynthia, who has been Karen's girlhood friend, and they graduated from high school together. They were in competition for position in high school graduating class. At the very last minute, Cynthia went ahead, and Cynthia graduated fifth and Karen graduated sixth or something like that, I don't recalled. Another one was Donna. Donna was the roommate and I mentioned who then went on to fly for for Pan Am. And the third...she was the third...the additional matron of honor was Lucinda, and we have contact with her from time to time. She lives in Kansas city with her lawyer husband. Actually Lucinda and Dick came to visit us when we lived in England. And so they...they were the only people from our wedding which came to my change commander retirements a ceremony in England. And...and they were very interesting folks. We had the reception in the church fellowship hall. In...in those days, you didn't have dinners. You didn't have to have a large lavish dinner and so my parents did host a groomsmen...a grooms dinner the night before for all of the members of the wedding party and...and certain family members. But the reception after the wedding was a cake and punch receptions put on in the church fellowship hall and the ladies of the church did that for us and of course we contributed, made a contribution to their organization and they did a very nice job. The cake...the...the planning for the wedding was done by Karen. My wife is one of the hardest working people I know, and she...she put it all together because of the time her mother lived in Oklahoma, my parents were in Kansas. Karen put the wedding together and get all the planning. I...we broke the rule by...I picked her up from the hairdresser the morning of the wedding and took her to the church to check out the room where the reception will be held, only find out that the cake was fell over, so we the cake, put back up, and the cake was not lost. The weather that day was pretty horrible. It was...it was raining before the wedding. It stop long enough for us to have the the archer's swords and this is where the the the groomsmen...before groomsmen put the their sword...unsheath their swords, put them up, and the bride and the groom walk through armed. And the...the person, the officer on the left, who is the last one for the bride to cross, is supposed to take its sword and then swatter on the bottom, but we didn't do that. That's...that's a tradition that we did not...we did not. After the wedding and the reception, attending the wedding, three of my four grandparents attended. All four of my grandparents were alive of the time. My mother's father was very...he was just a home buddy. He was a very very shy man, so he did not come to wedding, but my other three grandparents did. My great aunt Lottie was there. Great aunt Lottie and my paternal grandparents lived together. She was like my third grandmother. Aunt Jennie, uncle George, aunt Pat, uncle Bob. Many of the cousins from my side. Karen's father had died just before she started university, and so she was escorted down the aisle by her...her brother Bob. Three kids in her family. She was the oldest, Bob the second, and then...and Rick was present but he did not have a role in the wedding because he's basically the idiot we didn't trust to do anything. Karen's mother was there, seated with her grandmother. Grandmother was driven down by aunts and uncles from Paris, Missouri, where...where she lived in town after they off the farm and both of them die in Paris, Missouri, and we periodically visit the grave there.

3768_NormalText_INTERVIEW_ONLY_8-21-20. transcript.edited.txt," Okay uh this happened in nineteen sixty-five when I was twenty-four years old. I was uh, officer on a destroyer escort United States navy and we have been deployed into the south pacific on a special mission, and as it turns out, the mission was much longer than we had anticipated and we were running low on fuel and we, I was a communications officer and I had uh, the captain asked me to uh send a message to pearl harbor asking for an oiler to come down to refuel us, and the answer back was you, we don't have an oiler in your part of the Pacific Ocean. You have an op, one option of that is to go into American Samoa and see if you can refuel.  So, the next morning, we came into the harbor at Pago Pago, American Samoa, and we were greeted by two native Samoans in an outrigger canoe paddling alongside as we pulled up to the refueling pier. As it turned out, the refueling pier was there specifically for the tuna fleet that operated out of American Samoa, and it was essentially like a big gas station. Our first problem was realizing that this gas station was gonna be pumping the fuel, but we needed seventy-eight thousand gallons of diesel fuel. So, it was gonna take twenty-four hours to refuel the ship.  So, the remainder of the day, we went about our business, and the next morning on, it was a Sunday morning, and a number of us did not have the duty on the ship, and so we were asking ourselves, _x0080__x009c_Shall we go into town, and if we go into town,  what in the world shall we be doing?_x0080__x009d_ and a bunch of us, the junior officers, decided let's go to church, see what church in Samoa is like.  And so, five of us went off and we were walking down the main street of, of town  and there was a church over on the left-hand side on the opposite side of the harbor, and so we said, _x0080__x009c_Well, let's go in there,_x0080__x009d_ and we had no idea what the denomination of the church was or anything else.  So, we walked in and the five of us sat like in the back row, and the services began and that became one of the unique experiences of our lives because among other things, they um required all of the people instead of just passing the plate for donations like the typical church did, <they called,> they called people up individually if they had, were in  of their contributions to the church, <so they,> so you took all this peer pressure, _x0080__x009c_Oh so and so had to go up to the minister to hand him the money._x0080__x009d_  And, the organ was a hand-pumped organ. There was no electricity or anything else, and so there were two little boys who were pumping the bellows while the organ was playing, but the thing that absolutely stunned us beyond belief was the choir. That singing was incredible, and we looked at the hymnals and there, everything was in Samoan, so we had no idea, but we recognized the tunes of the songs that they were singing because they were regular hill Christian hymns.  But there was no music. There was simply the words to each one of the hymns was in the hymnal. There was no, no score, and I'm a clarinet player and I, so I reckon, yeah I was like, _x0080__x009c_I could sing along if I had the score, but you never _x0080__x009d_ anyway.  But it was a mixed choir, the men and the women, and they were the most beautiful voices I have ever heard in my life. And the five of us, well we left the, and the service was all in Samoan they, they hadn_x0080__x0099_t been speaking English at all so we had no idea what they were saying with what the sermon was about or anything else, but just the experience of being in a church in a totally different culture in the middle of the south pacific was just so much fun.  And so, when we, when it was all over and the five of us are walking out, the minister's out there to greet us all, and of course they spoke English because it's in American Samoa. And um. we never did find out what the denomination of the church was, but we, after we finished getting refuel and took off to finish our mission and we went back to Honolulu. When I got home with my wife, I told her I said, _x0080__x009c_You know I had an experience in the south pacific._x0080__x009d_ and I explained to her what had happened and I said, _x0080__x009c_I now know what the heavenly hosts sounds like._x0080__x009d_  a choir in this church in American Samoa,  And to finish the story, thirty-eight years later, she and I are on a cruise in the south pacific to Tahiti and Samoa, and as luck would have it, our day in American Samoa was a Sunday.  And everyone on the ships were like, _x0080__x009c_Oh we_x0080__x0099_re here in the  what are we gonna do if everything's going to be closed on a Sunday?_x0080__x009d_ and they, so, the people we've gotten friends with said, _x0080__x009c_What are you gonna do?_x0080__x009d_ I said, _x0080__x009c_We're going to church._x0080__x009d_  I took my wife to the church. Thirty-eight years later, and the same thing. The singing, everything, they were so nice to her, was hot, muggy. One of the ladies gave her a fan so she would stay cool after. Lent her her fan and she insisted she keep it, and so, but things have been upgraded thirty-eight years. The organ was electric. There were no kids pumping. And, and when they started singing, my wife literally started crying.  She was so overcome with emotion of the voices, and I said, _x0080__x009c_Look, it's gotta be different people thirty-eight years later,_x0080__x009d_ but boy oh boy it is exactly the same sound.

3773_INTERVIEW_ONLY_9-3-20.transcript.edited.txt," we were on a trip in uh in Peru and we had just finished a nine-day uh boat trip up the river of ah Ucayali I think it was called. and uhm on that boat, we had very uhm limited quarters. it was like a a tiny little box with where the slots on the wall were very far apart so you could see through to the next little box and there were upper and lower uh deds beds but because we were Americans, and probably their first American passenger, they gave us a room all of our own. So, uhm we rode on that boat for those nine days. they had told us it would be four days, but it turned out to be nine days because we didn't speak Spanish well and we didn't understand that he was saying that uh it was a four-day trip except when the water was low, which would be nine days and the water was low. so, the trip was very long. we had bought a  a case of beer to drink on the way because we were concerned about the water and so, we had to start limiting our water. and when we finally got to the end of the trip, which was at the head of the amazon river, at Iquitos, uhm we uh found a hotel and went into the hotel and uh since we were on our honeymoon and it had been nine days since we'd had any sex, so uhm that was our immediate choice of activity when we got to the hotel. and that was where our child was was conceived. we did not intend to have a child that soon, but we had not taken the precautions that we needed to do to prevent the pregnancy. So, that's how I ended up with a baby so early in my marriage and uh the final little episode, well there were a bunch of little episodes, but uh we went down to the lobby and had a glass asked for a glass of orange juice, because we were afraid of drinking water, and they gave me orange juice with ice in it and I thought  Ã_x0092_oh well, we been in Peru for a month so, it oughtta be alright.Ã_x0093_ So, i drank the ice in the juice and I got sicker than a dog. So, that was the end of the trip. but it didn't bother my pregnancy even though I didn't know I was pregnant. Uhm the hotel was very simple uhm, but it was nice enough. they had a room in there, there was a bathroom down the hall, and the beds were uhm kind of like old old old fashioned hospital beds where there was an adjustable metal frame, and they were separate beds- uh twin beds. And uh but uh Peru was trying to encourage uhm tourism at that time, this was in nineteen fifty-eight and so, they had built nice- mick rather rest uh hotels at every really keen place in Peru where people could travel from one day to the next thing. So, these hotels were meant to encourage businessmen salespeople so forth to be able to have a decent place to stay because most of the other hotels were justÃ_x0089_ I saw one where the room- it was a great big room- with uh hammocks for the women and another great big room with hammocks for the men and and the women had all their babies with them so, it was like a really noisy night. So, we were very we were very happy to find that hotel. I donÃ_x0095_t have I donÃ_x0095_t have any memory of that. I do remember that uh uh I had wanted to buy and- we didn't know we were gonna go on all these trips when we went down there, uh it just turned out that it was so cheap to travel then that we could travel for four dollars a day and eat our meals and everything. So, our trip instead of being two weeks was two months and uh IÃ_x0095_ve had taken basically skirts and blouses and uh I wanted to buy some pants. So, i went to a local uh market in the streets but Peruvian people are very tiny and uh and of course, we could both- i was five eight and so was my husband- we could see over the crowd, and I had felt like I knew how it was like to be tall. And when I tried to find pants, The only pants that were long enough were uh big. So, it was really hard for me to find something that I could wear there but uhm it was alright.

So, we had, um, moved_x0080_¦ we moved to, um, Florida, Jerry was in the Air Force, and we moved from Texas to, um, Tampa, and went home to Pennsylvania on the way and while we were traveling back there was a lot of, um, lumber being shipped on the road, and I_x0080__x0099_m allergic to pine, and so I had this really bad reaction, and when we got to Tampa I went to the clinic to see if I- you know what was wrong if it was flu or a cold or whatever, and we were living in a temporary, uh, quarters that the Air Force provided, and my husband went to work the ne- on Monday, no, it was on a Saturday, um, and he got a call at work, and it was the hospital, and they asked to speak to me, well we didn't have a phone, this was 1967, so, nobody had cellphones in those days and the woman said, _x0080__x009c_Well I can_x0080__x0099_t talk to ya, I need to talk to Nancy,_x0080__x009d_ and Jerry said, _x0080__x009c_Well, that's never gonna happen here,_x0080__x009d_ um, _x0080__x009c_I-I- you_x0080__x0099_re gonna have to give me a message,_x0080__x009d_ and she said, _x0080__x009c_Well, it's confidential the way the law works, but I can tell you the rabbit died,_x0080__x009d_ and he goes, _x0080__x009c_What?_x0080__x009d_ He had no idea what that meant, um, she said, _x0080__x009c_Well, you'll just have to tell your wife and she_x0080__x0099_ll know what you're talking about._x0080__x009d_ So, he got home from work, and he said, _x0080__x009c_They called from the clinic.

So, that was in August. We finally got into an apartment, had our stuff delivered, I got a job teaching at Tampa Catholic High School, kind of picked up a bunch of classes cause school had started the- the week before. Happy girl! I had one section of ninth grade English that was all boys. They had the kids divided by ability. They also had a school that recruited athletes.

Well, by Christmas, you could tell I was pregnant, and so in those days, it was 1967, you couldn't stay in a classroom once you were showing. So, I told them I wouldn't be back after Christmas, and I have other classes and so I let, you know, all of them know. Well, these boys got their moms and my last day, they had a shower for me, and we got blue sweaters, blue blankets, all these little boy things, and it was just the sweetest thing, they were- it was just amazing to me. So, come May, we finally, after weeks, and weeks, and weeks, it was about eleven o'clock at night and my water broke, and I said, _x0080__x009c_Jerry!_x0080__x009d_ He goes, _x0080__x009c_Well, we_x0080__x0099_re go- off to the hospital._x0080__x009d_ He said, _x0080__x009c_Hey, it_x0080__x0099_s not_x0080_¦_x0080__x009d_ His sister had delivered a child in her bathroom, and he did not wanna deal with that- well it was her third, this is our first.

So there I sat, or lay, he said, _x0080__x009c_Every time you see yours- your belly shrink, push._x0080__x009d_ So, that's what I did, and Frank would come in periodically, I would have a puff of his cigarette, and he could just talk about whatever. Finally, three o'clock he goes, _x0080__x009c_Okay, I guess we're just gonna have to bring this little child into the world,_x0080__x009d_ and, you know, when you see TV, it's like this room, and there these people, and all this stuff.

Um i thought i had missed my opportunity to go to New York um like all of my cousins had. It was a grand adventure.  Ah they all went back when my uncle managed the New York Yankees. so he retired or he was fired from the Yankees and um and so he sat out a year and that was he he was his last season with the Yankees was nineteen sixty. So nineteen sixty one he did not manage any um any anything. He didn't receive a paycheck from a major league um baseball team. anyway the New York Mets decided to um hire him as their inaugural manager because he had a great reputation with the fans. he was um well his branch rickey said he's the best connection there ever was between the team and the fans. so what the New York Mets needed was they  needed somebody that was a great ambassador to bring in all of the money at the turnstiles so that um they may not have great players but they needed the money so that they could buy the great players. Anyway i was able to go back. um they invited me for his first season with the Mets and it was right after my one of my grandfather's deaths and so it was at the um funeral that i was invited to go back so we had to go shopping because i was fifteen years old in southern California and that the clothes i wore was not going to work in New York so probably the most fun dress i got to buy was a black dress the basic black dress with a um it was just beautiful. i kept wearing it even in college. it was my basic black dress and um we made clothes because you didn't buy that much. you made your clothes back in the sixties. so eventually the day arrived and i got on the airplane. It was my very first airplane ride ever and of course we were in first class so i was sitting there first class with my aunt and we were served lobster thermidor for lunch. i had never tasted it. Um i learned to love it and it was airplane food but i learned love it and um ordered it quite frequently in New York and then she took had to use the restroom because it was across country so she gave me specific instructions of how to use the bathroom in the um in the cabinet. so off i went and the  but she says no you go in you use it and then after you've washed your hands you wipe it all down with a paper towel so that the next person goes in it's in perfect it was like it was brand new had just been clean. so that was that was a great introduction that still lives with me today and i have taught it to all of my children and grandchildren. Um so we arrive in New York City. we stay at the essex house, which is exactly across the street from central park and it's you know it was great. Um the importance of the essex house was that was their home away from home they always stayed in the very same apartment and we had my cousin was meeting us there and my cousin and i had a room around the corner. Um so we um we got to see you know the statue of liberty, the empire state building, and there were no world world trade things. we went out to net stadium, which was the polo grounds at the time and would be replaced eventually by the um by the Mets stadium um shey stadium. Um how am I doing? Do you want me to keep going?   okay   Oh lord I went to the to the hotel.  Probably went to the essex house and um and then depending we went to all the games while they were in town. there were other games when they were out of town had on the road. so the days they were out of town and on the road we would go to the broadway  Shows, to the mantinee. um we always had ah lunch at a deli depending on where we were on broadway and let me see. we saw i saw sound of music. then i went to um so i clearly remember that one sound of music my aunt knew the children that played in that so we were greatly received and then we went to radio city music hall another day and watched that touch of mink with Doris Day and ah Cary Grant.  was it Cary Grant? might have been Rock Hudson. i'd have to_x0080_¦ I_x0080__x0099_d have to think about that one.

I would have been twenty years old and I was attending Drake University and I was a very big basketball fan of Drake University and in that particular year they went to the final four championships in Louisville, Kentucky.  Umm a good friend of mine in my fraternity was able to get tickets for a number of us to go to the final four game in Louisville. This would have been in March nineteen seventy and we drove there it was about a five hundred mile drive from the Des Moines, Iowa to Louisville, Kentucky and um we stayed at the Executive Inn and uh  we went to the games. the game that I am speaking of was the umm the first round in which Drake was playing UCLA, who was the number one team in the country at that time and um uh coached by John Wooden and they had incredible players like uh um um Lou Alisander was his name then and ah Lynn Shackelford and uh some of the greatest players in all of college history.  Uh Drake had a very good team too and um the starting five players had all played together for like three years and um the media gave them very very slim odds of winning the game. Ah I really didn't think that they were going to win it but we were there to support them and the game was probably one of the most exciting basketball games I've ever been to. Ah in fact, um Drake was leading at the half time and they went on to play UCLA right down to the final second and they lost um at the buzzer when UCLA scored a shot and they didn't have three point shots in those days so um it was the only time in his whole career even into the NBA ah that Lou Alisander had three shots blocked in one game so um that was an amazing moment in my life and um I I will always think back on it as a lesson in when the odds are very small and you're not given a lot of chance of winning something that was a team that proved that they could stand up against the greatest and by the way in the consolation game then of the final four, they beat the number two uh team in the country North Carolina by twenty five points so it was really an incredible experience for me and one that I'll never forget.  I was so focused on the game that there was very little else that went on uh during that weekend.  Um  I mean I don't know how long I've spoken but_x0080_¦  a few more minutes?  Okay.

Um and then when I walk down the aisle my dad walked me down the aisle. Um  it was just wonderful having him there because uh my parents had been divorced but so he was had come back from Thailand for the wedding festivities in the week and so he walked me down the aisle and that was just a precious moment and then watched seeing my husband to be then  standing at the end of the aisle it was just so fun hum.  he always made me laugh and he was always so calm. There he was just anchoring the all of the people at the altar. So I just kept my eyes on him and his beautiful smile ah and walked up there with him and kissed by dad and we had our wedding ceremony and then I remember feeling  so elated when it was when we were pronounced man and wife and he got to kiss me and we turned and we faced the congregation and I just threw my hands up and smiled at him and we walked triumphantly down the aisle.  Ah it was so fun and it it's obviously a very vivid memory to me and then we we had exited the beautiful sunshine outside and we were so happy i just smiled the entire day and then we got in the car and we drove to his parents' house which was a little ways outside of town in in their beautiful backyard which um was ah this wonderful enclosed space just beautifully lanced center we had the wedding reception and the house was a beautiful post adobe out in the country and it was set up wonderfully for entertaining so we could have food inside you could mingle outside and it there was plenty of places to sit and the weather uh was just spectacular um  and my husband uh had been when we were planning the wedding he said  i don't care  you'll take care of everything else but i'm in charge of the cake because he said i love frosting  *laughing* and I want that cake to be what i want because i'm going to enjoy that first cut of cake and I_x0080__x0099_m going to find the one with the most frosting to be our first piece of cake  and so um he did he we cut the cake that he had worked on.

3801_NormalText.INTERVIEW_ONLY_edited.txt," Okay. In April. Early April, ah, nineteen sixty nine I was a ah sophomore at Harvard University and this was the time of lots of protests on University campuses. Uh particular antiwar protests against the war in Vietnam, but also local issues. Um in some ways not unlike what's happening right now in in in this point , um and in some ways very different. And and and so in early april the uh, the local chapter of SDS students for a democratic society which was uh, probably the biggest umbrella organization um for protesting in radicalization in the country, decided um that they would launch a protest at Harvard. I was a ah a member of the SDS at that point, although more out of just gone along with the crowd then out of a lot of conviction. Um, by the way, the Harvard chapter of SDS was the biggest university uh chapter in the country which people don't realize bigger than berkeley and a lot of the other places. And so, uh, uh, about noon time in early April and middle week, I think it was a Wednesday, um some of the SDS students occupied University Hall, which was the um, which was the administrative uh building for for Harverd and went in, kicked out the staff in the Deans and set up an occupation. I was not a leader in SDS, I was not apart of that, but ah not too long afterwards I went in afterwards just kinda to see what was going on. And uh as I was moving around uh, the building I sat in the desk of one of the Deans who had been kicked out, carried out uh of the uh uphold  and uh, I and I thought oh this is kind of neat. So I called up, I picked up the phone and I called the ah the woman I was dating at the time, and I said _x0080__x009c_guess where I am?_x0080__x009d_ And uh she, ya know,  we had a conversation and uh I said I_x0080__x0099_m sitting a Dean so-and-so's desk and reach most occupied University Hall and uh here's a cookie jar and i'm eating one of his cookies here. And there was a long pause on the phone, and she said to me _x0080__x009c_why are you doing that?_x0080__x009d_ and I went, in my mind, damn I have no idea why I'm doing this other than just going along with it. And it sparked something in me and I thought how do you decide what is right and wrong? How do you make a decision like that? And a few minutes later I got up and I left University Hall. I came back later that evening to hear some of the, the decision making of protests and and and then decided I didn't really wanna be a part of it at that point and went back to my dorm. At about five thirty, six o'clock the next morning um the police came in and arrested everybody at University Hall and uh many of them were uh kicked out of Harvard after that or discipline for that. Why that event is so important for me is because of the question that I asked sitting at the Dean's desk. Um, how do you know what is right or wrong? I I'd grown up in a religious home, and ya know, I went to church and that was just part of what I, we did. But when I got into college it really wasn't a part of me, and so it wasn't that I  was it just was really important, and that and is me thinking how do I how do I know right from wrong? How do I know anything? And that began my adult  for what I really uh really believed in myself and not taking over from my parents. So I started looking  all kinds of over the next few months asking myself, ya know, what is true? Can I believe this? What is this? And and uh on the scope of that day, obviously that day was so important because by by the next year um. My my uh internet just went a little bit off so I've  just got my camera off but uh you can hear me still. By the end of the uh of the year, I'd really come to a place where I said um you know, the Christian faith that I grew up in is really what I believe. And I and I had a chance to look at other face and other systems of belief and come back and as I did that uh there was a very clear sense in my mind that God was calling me to be a Priest, in in his church. And I obviously spent a year or two thinking about that. That was never in my thoughts I'd never thought about that it was a was a brand new direction for my life. Uh, a lot of people were really shocked when I told them that _x0080__x0098_cause they hadn't seen that coming either. Um, but but that one day in April was the start of that process. And uh and really planned the direction of thinking of what , how do you know what's right or wrong? How do you know anything? Where should your life go? And things like that. So that is probably one of the most important days in my life.

I left the main campus and went to my...to what was called a...what was it called? I don't know. Like an extension campus, much smaller, and it was in downtown city at a...at a office building basically and  we probably had one hundred or two hundred students something like that. And we met and I drove my car actually from my aunts. My great aunt allowed me...she lived in that town. And for the next three semesters, I was able to stay in her home with the rest of her family. And then as that was much closer, I was kind of regarded as a handy man when she needed some jobs down or something like that, so I was...I worked out pretty well. So we went to the downtown place where there was no specific parking and we just parked on the streets at not quite the main section of downtown but still downtown. We found a parking space wherever we could, sometimes it was several blocks as we walk to get to the actual building where it was. And so that's where the classes were. They were, again, typical classes of twenty people or so, almost only men. I think that probably was only at this particular place. And was there for the next three semesters and made some friends.  one, a lifetime friends still in touch with regularly, even though we both moved to the west coast from the Midwest, where the original campus was. So those are some of the main memories I think. Oh, I can tell you we went to one class next campus of a different university right next to us. Mine was Purdue, the other was Indiana University. And again this was extension in a downtown office building, no special deal whatever. And two of us engineering types were required after our three semesters there plus one, so we were...we had to leave, we couldn't do the rest of the campus at this campus, had to go to the main campus back again. Okay. Before we left that summer, this buddy of mine and I had to take a liberal arts class, so we went next door at Indiana University and took the class and the other students were about eighteen or twenty, and they were used to liberal arts classes, and we were only used to, my buddy and I, classes that had answers and we use slide rules. I'm tell you how far back it was. It was mathematically oriented, so we had it completely shift our mentality to the...there was no real answer. The course is liberal arts type course and something or other, I can't remember, but the...they looked at us like we were weirdos and we looked at them when I see them they...the Indiana University students, we were the two oddballs. And it was just like, we were from Mars and they were from Venus, and it was complicated process. But it worked. I think I got a B or something, maybe even an A.

So that was pretty fun and I drove into Berkeley the first night and had dinner out and and actually this was the timing was that it was my going to be my twenty first birthday that day that's right that's what I planned it for and I went out and I remember ordering a beer for the first time you know legally and then I met some people in the restaurant that night and they we got to be friendly and they invited me down the next day to Santa Cruz so I went I backtrack to Santa Cruz and um spent the night with some new friends and back up and then I remember walking around Berkeley it was just wonderful with them this new friend that I met and then the next day or so I said goodbye and I proceeded along and the next night I actually made it up to Humboldt County beautiful forest redwoods and that night I slept and I pulled my little car into a campground and laid my seat down and locked up the door so I felt secure and spent that night there that was wonderful. Then the next day I proceeded up into um Oregan and I had the name of and I had made arrangements to stay on an old communal farm way out in the middle of nowhere and so I spent the next many days there working the land and meeting people and just living like on a commune and it was pretty wonderful and then I used to actually you know headed back and saw some other friends on the way back but what I remember was just an incredible sense of independence and excitement and adventure and yeah it was a very memorable trip.  Well tell you a couple little things that happened so on that trip I actually had a little budding romance with somebody who lived in Los Angeles and so that we met up afterwards and continued to to go out for a while and become real close and um so that was like a little extra added from the trip and um yeah I guess that_x0080__x0099_s about it.  Things like that I remembered the at the commune at at the farm house remember me all the homemade milks and cheeses and oh one of the other things about being on a farm I did one of my jobs was wood chopping and so I was out there axing you know chopping splitting wood and that was um pretty fun and hard and exciting but uh you know then just the kind of the big meals and the and the gatherings and um so yeah.

3838_NormalText_INTERVIEW_ONLY_07-30-20.edited (1).txt," Um asia A memorable event or series of events in my life of had to do with her finishing high school and deciding what to do after that and then after deciding I wanted to go to college the process of going through that that um selection and sorting system and the multiple events that happened along the way. Second place is there  Ah yes The specific event stands out to me was the influence and pressure by my parents about where to go to college ah the process at the beginning I knew that I wanted to be a naval officer and my dad retired navy and also I grew up here in San Diego would kind of um learned a lot about history through the john birch society and all that conservative stuff but but generally it was just a feeling that the military was an important thing that I felt everyone had to do and I um ah I wanted to go in the navy because of my dad. So the process started I actually had appointments to all three of the military academies and um but then there was up I realize that either going to an academy or NROTC was a way to go so for the academies I um I really decided that i did not wanna go to school where was only boys because back at that time it was really different than it is now. So I thoroughly pursued the up arrow to see route and in doing that ugh I spent a lotta time with my counselors a chula vista high school gandalf or I also was student body president and I was on varsity athletics for three years and I had a lot of encouragement from my counselors at college to go to a a really um high level elite college but back then we didn't think about colleges away we do now but but anyway so I proceeded to um make applications I think I'm tyring to remember I may be wrong about this but my recollection is I applied to thirteen colleges to get into and NROTC program and ah also I was accepted by thirteen colleges at three and um it was very interesting because was if you laid those colleges out they included like um you see UCLA, Stanford, how Harvard, Princeton, Yale um and is probably universe of Texas and the universe in New Mexico but I was I really got strong support from my counselors for being accepted at the ivy league schools hum and it was interesting the interaction my parents um a basically they were born dirt poor in texas rural taxes during the depression and I I feel so vividly remember a comment from my mother I said you can't go to those schools back east because you have to wear a suit when you eat dinner and you don't have a suit and I thought well yeah I mean I probably can get one or something but essentially it was the message was you not good enough to go to an ivy league school no one in my car in my family never gone to college hum so looking at those choices I I then thought about sanford which really than a good school but but on the other hand I quite frankly had this internal motivation internally I wanted to get the hell out of California I just wanted to get away from where I was. So I undone so coincidentally in this process I yeah I received a letter from a guy that I knew I would the chula vista high school a one of in a hilltop high schools also in chula vista. So one of the cross country guys empty hilltop with a Brian Webber and he had gone into the rotc program at the university of New Mexico the year before and somehow he found out that I had applied to UNAM and Brian got a whole a man there was really a lot of effort from the universe and new actually go to recruit me so it was really a very stressful decision for me to make but I really I think today it was really this whole thing about by you know or you're not good enough to go there and you don't deserve it and so yeah gone in New Mexico that we likely to be in California go San Diego state but New Mexico's not too far away so anyway I chose universe in New Mexico and entered into the ROTC program and now in  Yeah it it was because I really really felt i'm kind of in a vacuum I getting encouragement from my ah teachers and college advisor ugh and I I did not get any um any encouragement other than your accepted from the other twelve schools of portals it seem like that new mexico was probably a good choice and particularly because I my my thought is that I want to be a career naval officer and I really didn't care what I studied her it academics or not a real high priority for me at that time you know the irony of it is Brian Webber ah when he graduated from your UNM them went to ah out we went into the  Marine Corps training school in Virginia which is basically the fbi people go and you learn how to speak vietnamese language and highly trained and he went to vietnam and it was killed the first day so it's really a sad experience about that but anyway that's a pretty formidable decision that I made and a course like anything else I mean you can't go back  You know many times you kind of wonder a lot if. Oh I would have gone to UCLA or USC and also I had I had an academic scholarship to USCand down but for some reason I didn't wanna do their coaches solely focused on the Navy I think probably the thing that always is the most interesting to me it was history and social studies and stuff like that and the best teacher I ever had was in trade for civics and psycho thought that that might be why would do but what I did actually is I got to UNM and I went in education and I did that because it didn't have a language requirement. Was really it really a pretty short sighted decision but by then I had a good education at UNM ah  Yeah it's um and I also know that um it's interesting when I was in the navy yeah on our ship I remember that my my bunk mate was a guy a gone to Stanford and we used to compare a class we took many by the same exact classes and i'm certain that the quality of education I got a and was much better than he got but you know basically the way that visually great schools work if kids good enough to get into it they're going gonna do well regardless  Yeah I think it the the really big difference however is see is your peers and the interactions and stuff like that and I had some had some good experiences with added you and UNM but it would have been different in new york bill is also possible and I wouldn't really felt uncomfortable there because I really was not until one of them but again ",Normal,20,0,75.0,1.0,18.0,1224.0,441.0,94.0,66.0,11.0,78.0,134.0,3.0,0.360294118,0.987725041,3838,7299.0,671.0,20.8,177.0,0.0919304014248527,0.263785394932936,0.0309985096870343

I met him while I was at the University of Michigan in graduate school and he was too. Um we were living in the same apartment complex. I was living with three other gals and he was living with three other guys just down the hall. Do we became good friends and did a lot of things together the my my girlfriend's and than his boyfriends and um so then he and I developed a more romantic interest in each other and um ended up getting married. Ah I got a kick out of it I always remember his his apartment of guys because there are four guys three of them were named Jim so and then one was Greg and so you never knew which Jim we were talking about when we talking about Jim. Oh anyway uh Jim was catholic and so was I so that was perfect because when you're catholic it's a good idea to marry someone whose also catholic. So we did we were married in my hometown of Jackson, Michiganand it was um back in nineteen seventy. So um we're in our twenties and he um I made my wedding dress um which I was almost a disaster because I went to cut it out on the ping pong table I reversed the pattern such a way that when it was cut out it was like oh my gosh it's all in reverse but it was fine. And my mother made all of the bridesmaids' dresses so it was just it was nice that way um so we were married in the uh the church in Jackson its um it wasn_x0080__x0099_t it technically a cathedral but it was a cathedral style church so was it was it was very beautiful. So that was very very fun and un very nice and then he and I went on a on a nice honeymoon together and have a great time and um we_x0080__x0099_d um lived together in Ann Arbor because that was for the university of Michigan was so that just meant that uh we are starting our life together in a small little apartment. The University of Michigan um which is always fun to be in a university town because it's just very um very lively and very challenging and just you know very active ah especially with the University of Michigan football team so you went to the football games a lot and just involved in all the activity there. So um let me see he um and I had motorcycle riding in common. He actually bought one the very first um um uh seven fifty Honda motorcycles which right off it was right off the press that was a big deal so we got on that on the motorcycle and we traveled across the country together. That was a nice thing that we had in common. So uh he was a a tall six foot four and I was five foot four so there was a foot of difference between us. So one night we would have to we would have discussions I would have to get out a little stools so that we could go eye to eye so that he knew I was serious about what I wanted to say. But I guess they so we um we have the University of Michigan in common we had motorcycle riding a common we are catholic religion in common which was very important and um um uh so we did well together and then he decided that he wanted to after he graduated um he wanted to find a job and decided to head out to the west coast to see if he could find something to do. I was working about thirty miles away in my hometown of Jackson, Michigan as a schoolteacher. So I was commuting back and forth each day. So it would have been nice to get rid of that. So um off we went on out life we do decided that we're gonna change states change what we did and um we were newly married and um so it was good. So we came to California as a married couple and um he found a a job working at the architecture field cause that was what he was doing and I um I was struggling to find a job as a teacher took me about a year to do that in meantime I just picked up odd jobs um and that was that was fun and getting used to California getting used to San Diego it was very different because we came from University of Michigan which was a very liberal community and across San Diego it is much more conservative and uh we weren_x0080__x0099_t quite used to that politically. So it took us a while to kind of get into that that that political kind of thing but San Diego itself that I mean you couldn_x0080__x0099_t end up in a better place in terms of climate and everything that was going on around and just the beach community and uh getting involved in all that kind of stuff here. So uh of course we had motorcycles in common so we each bought a motorcycle when we came out to California so he had his now and I had my own my very own motorcycle so that we continue that interests together um and um.

So um my husband at the time it was an avid scuba diver and his favorite place to scuba dive or snorkel was at La Jolla Cove so we decided it was a beautiful day so we decided to go walk over in the La Jolla Cove area ummm because it was a great day and he loves the ocean so we went we went walking and we walking along the sidewalk we took a little bit of a different path up on the ummm kind of on the rocky area but it was it wasn_x0080__x0099_t dangerous it was pretty safe. And ummm my my my husband happened to look over where the rocks  are close to the cave i don't know if you know where that cave is in the La Jolla Cove area and he saw that this diver was trying to get out of the water but the waves kept pushing him back into into the rocks so ummm my husband is a former umm corman and at the time he was in health care and he's always been a helpful person so he saw that the person was you could tell he was getting tired because he was he wasn't swimming as strong he was so so at the time he uhh he decided to go down there and help him while i am a wreck because i'm thinking okay we're about to have a child you_x0080__x0099_re down there i don't know how the situation is going to unfold from the point of danger cause the water was very rough uh but i know that he's a strong swimmer so i just had to give him the benefit of the doubt so he goes climb climbs down the rocks and tries to talk to the diver to tell him to go out with the current but then come back in and that he would help him get out of the water so um so all is going on the diver really couldn't hear him so he was trying to gesture to him what all this was going on so by that time they attracted a crowd around. i think they might have called for the lifeguards to come over to help out and the whole time i'm worried because this is the Sunday before Memorial Day that i don't know through my head was going the worst kind of thinking that oh my gosh i'm gonna have to give birth ummm i'm getting i'm getting nervous I_x0080__x0099_m I_x0080__x0099_m afraid for my husband at the time so anyways uh eventually he was able to get grab a hold of the diver and get him pulling out on the next wave he he held him so that he could stay on the rocks then helped him out of the water and uh and uh did all did all the things you know to help him be safe he was out of breath he was a struggling a little bit but he was just happy to be out of the water  so so that took about that was about an hour or so uh the thing that did happen was that later that day my water broke so i had a our our baby our son was born on memorial day umm which was monday and uh if the little ironic thing about that is that uh that was a first grandchild in our family and he happened to be born on my dad's birthday so memorial day May thirty first is is my dad's birthday and now it's my our son's birthday uh so the first grandchild what i said to my dad do not be expecting a birthday present like this every year because it's not gonna happen so uh so that's a story about umm the birth of of uh our child  yeah i was twenty six   it was it it had highs and it had lows you know depending on where the situation was you know i just had to trust that he would help the diver out because that to me seems dangerous  you know first first of all drowning is awful and that_x0080__x0099_s what I was afraid of so i was glad that my husband was able to help him out so anyways   they were on their way they were on their way   that part that part of the of the uh you know they had it come around they didn't think they could make a land recovery they thought they would have to get into a a boat and come over to to tell to they thought it was i mean based on what my husband said at the time he said a rock exit was going to be very dangerous but  it's all about timing with the waves so so he knew how to do it and so he could convey that to the to the person who was struggling in the water so it was a good thing uhh so anyways   yeah i'm trying to think where the where the boat would have come from because i don't do they had jet skis at the time that was you know almost forty seven years ago um so yeah they would have had to try to reach you don't make it and catch him in the waves somehow i don't know i don't know how they would have retrieved him but its like my ex said that was probably more dangerous way to do it but i could tell you its getting tired you know he probably should have dropped his tanks he probably should have dropped his gear but i think he maybe was a little panicky but anyways  it all ended up fine ended up fine   yes exactly i was happy,Normal,21,0,71.0,1.0,16.0,1077.0,303.0,112.0,37.0,9.0,21.0,149.0,10.0,0.281979458,0.98106766,8207,4863.0,580.0,29.8,230.0,0.119267941599835,0.396551724137931,0.0513793103448276

I had two older brothers and three younger ones, two brothers and a sister um the youngest one Jose Maseo was a baby in arms and was unable to walk at that time um my, my mom asked me I call her my mom she, she married my father when I was three and a half so she was pretty much my mom, but really my mom died when I was a year and a half old anyway my mom had left me in charge of little kids um and I continued to be in charge of the little kids until they went, until I went away to college anyway ah they kept us there all day and even though the flight was supposed to leave early in the morning they kept us there all day and we had to, when we were leaving, it was nightfall already and um on the way, on the tarmac in those days they didn't have those tunnels like they do now, so we had to walk across the, the tarmac and then climb up a flight of stairs to get into the plane anyway um as I was walking out, I was rubbing my eyes and my mom who was really not very demonstrative usually um said to me what's the matter and I said I have something in my eye and she said I do too and that was one of the times when, when we connected most deeply um because usually um the connection wasn't very strong um anyway we, we walked into the plane and up the stairs and as we were leaving, I notice that um we could see the lights over Cuba and then as we flew towards ah Miami, we could see um the lights in Miami and for a very long time, I, you know there was a popular Joni Mitchell song about lights in the city are pretty to me and I always thought no they didn't look pretty to me they looked sort of tawdry and dirty and unpleasant um.

So, a week after I graduated from high school, my two best friends and I, um, the two of us hi- hitchhiked up to where the third one lived, in Santa Barbara, um, from Los Angeles, and had dinner with his parents, and then his father drove us down to a hobo jungle, which is, n- now the site is Santa Barbara Zoo, but back then, it was a little freight yard. So, we wander around and talk to hobos, and, um, said we wanted to ride freight trains, and they all tried to talk us out of it_x0080_¦ and, uh, my friend Link_x0080__x0099_s dad decided he'd stay, and he parked over somewhere and waited to see if we were actually gonna do this, and, finally, my two friends decided it was a bad idea and they went back and got in the car and I watched drive away, and this one hobo I had been bugging, he kept telling me, you know, _x0080__x009c_Don't- you guys are young, go hitchhike, your clean, you're not old _x0080__x0098_whinos_x0080__x0099_ like us,_x0080__x009d_ um, you know, _x0080__x009c_You don't- you don_x0080__x0099_t need to do this._x0080__x009d_ I said, _x0080__x009c_No, I want to do it._x0080__x009d_ So, he so- he sorta grumbled and we- I sat there, next to his fire, train pulled in, he said, _x0080__x009c_Okay._x0080__x009d_ We ran up, he jumped on the train, helped me get on it, and we went off and I- it was a full moon night and we d-rode right outta Santa Barbara, right along the coast, if you_x0080__x0099_ve ever taken that train ride, but there the moon was over the ocean. I was sitting on this bo- on this box car with this_x0080_¦ you know, kinda smelly group of _x0080__x009c_whinos,_x0080__x009d_ you know? Hobos are interesting people, and, um, and, uh, we rode up all the way to San Jose, where I got off and, um, decided it was- it was dirty and horrible. I_x0080__x0099_d never ride a freight train again, I hitchhiked to my aunt's house in- in, uh, Cupertino, and I took a shower, and I started the summer, um, I ended up driving ten thousand miles, got all the way up to Fairbanks, Alaska, I left with fifteen bucks, I came back three months later with two hundred dollars and a car, and I had been ten thousand miles, and, uh, that started, uh, every summer I was in college I hitchhiked, rode freights, and worked just to travel around the country. Saw the whole United States that way. Keep going, or_x0080_¦ Well, in- in those_x0080_¦ yeah w- w- i- i-_x0080_¦ both my wife and I are big travel- big travelers, and, uh, you know, during the 60_x0080__x0099_s, when I was in college, I didn't have a lot of money, I didn_x0080__x0099_t get to go to Europe like all of my friends did, but I hitchhiked and rode freight trains, uh, through every state in the lower forty-eight, all over Alaska, and a lot of Canada, and I stopped and worked, um, you know, I'd worked for a week in a log mill, and fr- when I get paid I say, _x0080__x009c_Adios,_x0080__x009d_ and take off. Um, but pay_x0080_¦ I worked in a honey company, delivered cars, it was a real- I call it my Woody Guthrie period, and, um, and that, you know, that got me through college after I got, you know, went to work, um, I was very fortunate to work in, uh, places that allowed for travel. In my last job working for the museum, and, uh, I worked in museums my whole life. In Riverside, I got to travel to Vietnam, Korea, India twice, and Japan with the mayor of Riverside. Dur_x0080_¦ During Sister City stuff and setting up exhibitions for the museum in Riverside, and then Lorraine and I have travelled as, you know, all over Europe, and, uh, she's come with me to some trips in Asia, she's traveled a lot more in Mexico than I have.

She and her mother just did this trip, uh, through Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan and all on the Silk Road, and the pictures she sent were absolutely breathtaking- of these ancient, uh, Islamic temples, um, and all kinds of interesting things that are still completely, you know, untouched, and, uh, we've- we figured out who- who her travel agent was, but, you know, we're waiting to get permission to go.",Normal,19,0,73.0,0.0,16.0,1023.0,384.0,44.0,58.0,19.0,66.0,128.0,6.0,0.375366569,0.994239631,8264,13770.0,1054.0,39.2,312.0,0.0765432098765432,0.296015180265655,0.0371916508538899
