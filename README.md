# Visualizing Speech and Biomarker Correlations in Alzheimer's Disease

**Credits:** This repository is built upon starter code provided by Andrew Wentzel, a member of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at UIC.

## Project Overview
**Client:** Dr. Natalie Parde  
**Project Title:** Visualizing Speech and Biomarker Correlations in Alzheimer's Disease

### Description

Currently, psychiatrists use Excel and SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) software to visualize data collected from the SLaCAD (Spoken Language Corpus for Alzheimer's Disease detection) dataset. However, due to the large number of modalities, it has been difficult to effectively visualize relationships and correlations. To address this, the goal of this project is to develop an interactive visualization tool that empowers psychiatrists to independently explore different acoustic and linguistic features, AD (Alzheimer's Disease) biomarkers, and how these relate to AD status.

### Project Significance

Alzheimer's Disease is a form of dementia that causes a progressive decline in cognitive abilities such as memory, thinking, reasoning, and judgment. Symptoms of AD usually appear later, by which time millions of brain cells are already damaged and cannot be saved.

Recent research shows that biomarkers in the preclinical phase of AD can indicate whether a person will develop the disease later in life. Similarly, people who are beginning to develop AD often show changes in how they speak or write long before memory problems appear in the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stage. The use of clinical markers (signs in thinking and behavior) in combination with biomarkers would really help scientists come up with less invasive (compared to blood draws) and more affordable ways (compared to brain imaging scans) in identifying whether a person has AD early to make treatment more effective too.

This project falls under the IEEE research area Representation and Interaction, as it focuses on the design of visual representations and interactive techniques for exploring different types of data, users, and visualization tasks.

### Consultant Client

**Name:** Dr. Natalie Parde  
**Department:** Computer Science  
**Background:** Co-Director of the UIC Natural Language Processing Laboratory and a faculty member of the AI.Health4All Center for Health Equity, where she focuses on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Her research interests mainly lie in natural language processing, particularly in healthcare applications, multimodality, and creative language. For this project, she will provide access to the Spoken Language Corpus for Alzheimer's Disease Detection (SLaCAD) dataset and connect us with PhD students from her NLP lab who helped develop the dataset.

## Data

The project will work with the SLaCAD (Spoken Language Corpus for Alzheimer's Disease detection) dataset containing:

- 7.5 hours of recorded and transcribed speech from 91 older participants
- Linguistic features (part-of-speech tags, named entity recognition, syntactic complexity measures, vocabulary richness)
- Acoustic features (voiced segments per second, unvoiced segment duration measurements)
- AD biomarker data (cerebrospinal fluid and plasma biomarkers)
- Clinical assessments (Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores, AD status)

## Project Status

This repository currently contains template code with placeholder visualizations. The actual implementation for the Alzheimer's Disease speech and biomarker visualization will be developed as part of this project.
